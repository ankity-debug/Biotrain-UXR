0:11:39 Dhananjay kumar: Office, when you go, first thing happens. First one hour, you are checking the e-mails, responding to urgent things and other things.
0:11:48 Dhananjay kumar: Then you have a sleep. Some meetings and then walk through the manufacturing 
0:11:53 Vidhi Thakker: line to see what is going on 
0:11:55 Dhananjay kumar: there. Any question, any problems, you just try to see what is going on on the floor. And then you come back.
0:12:04 Dhananjay kumar: And then again, either you are responding to e-mails, checking, reviewing. And then you come to the lunch break. And then after lunch break, again, you doing some desk job, and then there'll be some meetings.
0:12:20 Dhananjay kumar: Some problem solving or something, and then, it'll can carry on to five o'clock at six. And then, one, two, when I come back, when I get out of the office, then I go to the gym, or maybe not every day, once a couple of times, but twice or three days 
0:12:38 Vidhi Thakker: in a week. 
0:12:41 Dhananjay kumar: And then I come home and have a nap. I like to. And then it becomes just, either you are doing breakfast, reading or watching TV.
0:12:54 Dhananjay kumar: That's 
0:12:55 Vidhi Thakker: all. I see. So, would you say that, you engage in physical activity daily or 
0:13:05 Dhananjay kumar: not? Yes, I do 
0:13:07 Vidhi Thakker: daily. And you said that you stretch in the morning and do a little bit of, uh, 
0:13:16 Dhananjay kumar: walking? Okay, so basically, wake up in the morning, get out in the garden, walk ten minutes, come back. Do some Storji Namaskar, and then I do some meditation, and I do this, uh, uhm.

0:13:46 Vidhi Thakker: great. Mhm. And how long would you say you have been active in the gym for? 
0:13:56 Dhananjay kumar: After COVID. During COVID, no gym, but after COVID, it has been able to, yeah, since 
0:14:04 Vidhi Thakker: then. is 
0:14:05 Dhananjay kumar: 22. And, uh, I mean, on average, I have been like, two to three times. And then, uh. Two to three times a week, right?
0:14:18 Vidhi Thakker: A week, 
0:14:19 Dhananjay kumar: yeah. And during COVID, it was like walking every day, 10 to 15 kilometers. That had been quite 
0:14:27 Vidhi Thakker: normal for everyone here. 
0:14:29 Dhananjay kumar: I see. One and a half hours, two hours in the morning, two hours in the evening. 
0:14:36 Vidhi Thakker: Uh-huh. Any reason? Yeah, yeah, go 
0:14:41 Dhananjay kumar: on. Before COVID also, I had, I think. I think I will be most active in the gym or physical activity since 2018.
0:14:52 Dhananjay kumar: Before that, it has been. Not been that 
0:14:54 Vidhi Thakker: regular. No, any reason why particularly in 2018? 
0:15:01 Dhananjay kumar: Oh, before that, I was very busy in my job. I was, 
0:15:07 Vidhi Thakker: I see. And did you ever? Does your routine now look different from what your routine looked like in 
0:15:14 Dhananjay kumar: 2018? Totally 
0:15:17 Vidhi Thakker: different. Totally different. Can you walk me through your routine for 2018? 
0:15:23 Dhananjay kumar: Oh. Back up. Drop the children at the school. Go to the office. I'm around 8 o'clock at night. So only during the day.
0:15:41 Dhananjay kumar: During the weekend I could go for a walk. Uh-huh. So that has been 
0:15:46 Vidhi Thakker: tough. I see. What motivated you to start being more physically active? 
0:15:57 Dhananjay kumar: When you burn out, when you are traveling a lot, because 28, before 28, 14, I used to travel almost quite a 
0:16:09 Vidhi Thakker: lot, like 2 weeks 
0:16:11 Dhananjay kumar: in a month, 2 to 3 weeks, on different continents. to different time zones, so, you are totally, biological clock is totally messed 
0:16:22 Vidhi Thakker: I can imagine. 
0:16:24 Dhananjay kumar: And then, you, when you come 
0:16:27 Vidhi Thakker: home, 
0:16:29 Dhananjay kumar: you just. Want to relax, like, because when you're out of your house, you are interacting too many people doing a lot of things, getting.
0:16:38 Dhananjay kumar: Things done, getting prepared, getting ready, doing the presentation, having a meeting, contributing, everything. It's like the nature of the job I was 
0:16:49 Vidhi Thakker: doing. That's what it 
0:16:54 Dhananjay kumar: But now I'm, it's a quite, uh, R and D 
0:16:57 Vidhi Thakker: type work 
0:16:58 Dhananjay kumar: I'm doing, so it doesn't, it doesn't. I that much travel or anything. And the reason for that, like, you come to the point when you start to feel like, no, I can't do I need to change, so that's that's the 
0:17:12 Vidhi Thakker: thing. I see. I'm like, could you tell me? Yeah, go on. 
0:17:20 Dhananjay kumar: Like, I mean, one of the motivation becomes like, when you see of your peers, some peers are very fit. Yeah.
0:17:26 Dhananjay kumar: Very good. Very well. So that's where you get all other motivations. 
0:17:32 Vidhi Thakker: I see. Uhm, so could you tell me a little more about your, uh, regular sessions at the gym? Like, what do what time do you like to go, the frequency, the intensity that you 
0:17:46 Dhananjay kumar: work Normally, 
0:17:52 Vidhi Thakker: weekend, 
0:17:54 Dhananjay kumar: but I mean on Saturday and Sunday. 
0:17:58 Vidhi Thakker: So, Saturday, 
0:18:00 Dhananjay kumar: it's like 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock. It's a huge class. Yeah, it's a class. What do you call it? HIT class?
0:18:10 Vidhi Thakker: H-I-A-T. Mhm. So, 
0:18:15 Dhananjay kumar: that's like, those classes are like 30 minutes. I see. High, high 
0:18:21 Vidhi Thakker: intensity. 
0:18:22 Dhananjay kumar: And then, after that, either you, depending on how I'm speaking. So, either I run 10 minutes on the treadmill, or.
0:18:38 Dhananjay kumar: I walk on the treadmill, just to cool down. Then, do the stretching. Stretching is just like the stretching that you can do.
0:18:50 Dhananjay kumar: 10, 15 minutes. Yeah. I see. So that's a Saturday and two days more in a And that happens 
0:19:05 Vidhi Thakker: either twelve o'clock 
0:19:06 Dhananjay kumar: daytime or six o'clock 
0:19:09 Vidhi Thakker: evening. 
0:19:11 Dhananjay kumar: I see. Sunday, nothing, Sunday swimming. 
0:19:15 Vidhi Thakker: Yeah. Okay. Please go. Oh, swimming. Yeah. Interesting. Any other classes or activity that you 
0:19:23 Dhananjay kumar: engage? I have tried. A lot of yoga classes, uhm, uh, ballet, pilates.
0:19:35 Dhananjay kumar: Others, but some way, I enjoy the heat 
0:19:41 Vidhi Thakker: classes. Thank you. And have you ever worked out at home 
0:19:49 Dhananjay kumar: before? Yeah. Yeah. Done it. Done. In the buttocks. You don't get the motivation.
0:20:02 Dhananjay kumar: I have tried to do it, but not regularly. It never happened 
0:20:05 Vidhi Thakker: regularly. I see. Like, sometimes, So would you say that the challenge was just motivation or maybe it was like the space or not getting the appropriate guidance, 
0:20:19 Dhananjay kumar: maybe the equipment, anything else? Not space and those things are not important. That's not the main thing. 
0:20:24 Vidhi Thakker: It's a manly like 
0:20:27 Dhananjay kumar: motivation. Yeah, if somehow you sometimes. You feel down, but still, if you can drag 
0:20:33 Vidhi Thakker: yourself to the gene, 
0:20:36 Dhananjay kumar: then the environment, when you see other people doing what doing, it makes 
0:20:41 Vidhi Thakker: you going. 
0:20:43 Dhananjay kumar: When you are at home, you feel a bit down, a bit tired. So you don't get that motivation 
0:20:50 Vidhi Thakker: like. And how comfortable are you using your phone or, uh, phone? Fitness apps during your workout. It could be at the gym, it could be at your class, it could also be at 
0:21:09 Dhananjay kumar: home. Yeah, I use the Fitbit 
0:21:13 Vidhi Thakker: one. Oh, 
0:21:15 Dhananjay kumar: you use the Fitbit one? Yeah. 
0:21:17 Vidhi Thakker: Uh, is, Is there a particular 
0:21:20 Dhananjay kumar: app? Is it? Okay, Fitbit is a 
0:21:25 Vidhi Thakker: company. They have their own app Yeah. But 
0:21:30 Dhananjay kumar: it's not about like, is it just a. Heartbeat and other things, steps and cardio and other things.
0:21:43 Dhananjay kumar: An app that tells me to do 
0:21:45 Vidhi Thakker: something. Hmm, there's Omnitracks. Uh, could you tell me what kind of things it tracks? You mentioned, uh, heart rate and steps.
0:21:57 Vidhi Thakker: What else? Oh, okay. 
0:22:00 Dhananjay kumar: So, you can, so, it has a menu called, uh, 
0:22:08 Vidhi Thakker: exercise. In that exercise, 
0:22:12 Dhananjay kumar: you can, uhm, 
0:22:14 Vidhi Thakker: streaming. 
0:22:16 Dhananjay kumar: Running. 
0:22:18 Vidhi Thakker: Or if you're doing boot camp. 
0:22:20 Dhananjay kumar: Or you're doing cycling. Or you're doing surfing. Or if running. Or if you're Or hiking. There are a lot of boxes.
0:22:32 Dhananjay kumar: With a lot of, lot of things. Or you're doing your, your own workout on your own, suppose. 
0:22:40 Vidhi Thakker: So you can basically choose the 
0:22:45 Dhananjay kumar: kind of workout you're doing and then it tracks. Yeah, 
0:22:47 Vidhi Thakker: yeah. I 
0:22:49 Dhananjay kumar: see. Like in swimming, it gives me, oh, please go 
0:22:54 Vidhi Thakker: on. No, no, you can go on, 
0:22:57 Dhananjay kumar: continue. Like in swimming, it gives me how many laps I have done, how much time it took, and all those things, so I 
0:23:03 Vidhi Thakker: can. Do you think that kind of information is useful to you? Yeah. Could you tell me if you do use it?
0:23:17 Vidhi Thakker: Uh, how do you use it in your daily life now? Like, how do you incorporate that 
0:23:21 Dhananjay kumar: information? So when you do a specific thing. Like swimming, or doing the cardio, or 
0:23:30 Vidhi Thakker: anything. That 
0:23:33 Dhananjay kumar: list, you 
0:23:34 Vidhi Thakker: have that 
0:23:36 Dhananjay kumar: So when you do the next time, I mean, one thing that gives you motivation, at least I should be doing it.
0:23:44 Dhananjay kumar: It's good as I have done last 
0:23:45 Vidhi Thakker: week. 
0:23:47 Dhananjay kumar: I see. Just a bar, baseline you 
0:23:49 Vidhi Thakker: get. It helps you get 
0:23:51 Dhananjay kumar: motivated. Yeah, so like, you know, what is your baseline and then you try to stretch a bit. Can I do it a bit 
0:24:00 Vidhi Thakker: better? 
0:24:00 Dhananjay kumar: So you get a second address. I see. Then you try to do a bit 
0:24:05 Vidhi Thakker: better. 
0:24:07 Dhananjay kumar: That way it gives you motivation to stretch yourself. 
0:24:11 Vidhi Thakker: Uh-huh. I see. And would you say, like, for example, uh, when you started being more active at the gym or even yoga?
0:24:24 Vidhi Thakker: Did you follow any interactive guides or YouTube tutorials or anything like that? 
0:24:32 Dhananjay kumar: Yes, I did, but, I will, I will not say I followed any specific, anything 
0:24:50 Vidhi Thakker: specific, other So would you, say they were helpful, or not? 
0:25:01 Dhananjay kumar: Yeah, there are some, some of those who were helpful, yes. I didn't stick to anything specific. 
0:25:07 Vidhi Thakker: Uh, any particular 
0:25:11 Dhananjay kumar: reason? No, because none of them give complete coverage because, you know, everyone is involved. They are and they have their individual perspective, like physique or diet or the way they do it.
0:25:31 Dhananjay kumar: And the app or whatever it is, more or less, it's more 
0:25:35 Vidhi Thakker: generic. It's not 
0:25:38 Dhananjay kumar: customized for that, 
0:25:40 Vidhi Thakker: for 
0:25:40 Dhananjay kumar: me, so I, that give me the specific information. It's not the thing that suits to 
0:25:48 Vidhi Thakker: me. I see. So would you prefer maybe, uh, live coaching or if you had virtual 
0:25:59 Dhananjay kumar: support? Yeah. I mean, yeah, what I, I think, uh, recently I saw someone, what they do it when they are doing the.
0:26:09 Dhananjay kumar: They are recording 
0:26:12 Vidhi Thakker: themselves. 
0:26:14 Dhananjay kumar: Yeah. And then online coaches. So they can review it and give the feedback. That you should be doing these 
0:26:23 Vidhi Thakker: things. Do you think that is something that would be helpful to you? Yeah, definitely. I 
0:26:34 Dhananjay kumar: see. 
0:26:37 Vidhi Thakker: Ba, so ba, 
0:26:37 Dhananjay kumar: uh, giving baby… Uhm. I of myself to 
0:26:42 Vidhi Thakker: anybody. 
0:26:45 Dhananjay kumar: There are a lot of laws and regulations that you have to follow. That's the only thing. Got it. Uhm. Uh.
0:26:48 Dhananjay kumar: You 
0:26:49 Vidhi Thakker: know. Mhm. Oh, so. If you ever fail to follow blue on a workout day, or if say you skip a workout or something like that, huh?
0:27:05 Vidhi Thakker: How do you usually get yourself back on track? Uhh. 
0:27:09 Dhananjay kumar: Okay, the- the two. We'll in the thing happens, like, if you feel to do your work out, you know, whatever it happens, but often, so on.
0:27:20 Dhananjay kumar: And see you that's the natural thing, but then you feel bad, okay, and. And, I don't know if you get used to want 
0:27:32 Vidhi Thakker: something, 
0:27:34 Dhananjay kumar: and if you miss out. I'll see you start to feel like I'm missing something, or you start to feel lazy, or not feeling good.
0:27:44 Dhananjay kumar: Because you get- You when you are used to doing this, uhh, you feel happier after that. And she- So that's- the way I get my motivation, look, I'm missing.
0:27:57 Vidhi Thakker: Mm-hmm. And- And would you say you preferred working out alone with your friends or with a trainer or a community?
0:28:07 Dhananjay kumar: community. Okay, I do with the community and I do 
0:28:14 Vidhi Thakker: alone. 
0:28:16 Dhananjay kumar: and Could 
0:28:18 Vidhi Thakker: you elaborate a bit on the community, 
0:28:21 Dhananjay kumar: you say? I mean, community is initially the classes, you know, the to the class. 
0:28:24 Vidhi Thakker: Thank

0:28:39 Dhananjay kumar: again and again? Yeah. . . . Mm-hmm. 
0:28:43 Vidhi Thakker: I see. Do you feel like, because you see them again and again, they have some earlier faces, so do you think that 
0:28:50 Dhananjay kumar: helps? Yeah, 
0:28:51 Vidhi Thakker: definitely. 
0:28:55 Dhananjay kumar: I see. I mean, you feel a bit coming in.

0:29:23 Vidhi Thakker: 70. I see. And, uh, come- Coming back to your motivation. Do you feel like visible progress in your body, like when you look in the middle?
0:29:38 Vidhi Thakker: Do you think that is more helpful for your motivation, or maybe feed back 
0:29:42 Dhananjay kumar: from others? That takes ages. Just to look into the mirror and get the feed back. He's similar. Yeah, the real motivation comes from your insight.
0:29:53 Dhananjay kumar: So 
0:29:54 Vidhi Thakker: it's like you feel

0:44:22 Vidhi Thakker: Uh, if you don't mind me asking what to draw you to Fitbit? Like, what was it that made it stand out for

0:45:01 Dhananjay kumar: workout. No, I'm not tracking at Pillino. Sometimes I deal with that and then after that I, no, please suggest.

0:45:35 Vidhi Thakker: see. If you don't mind me asking, what is the most annoying? mind. What about manually tracking? Is it the fact that you maybe have to enter each set or we, or the fact that maybe you're- I'm only 
0:45:52 Dhananjay kumar: entering those things. 
0:46:06 Vidhi Thakker: I talked using an app. I know you mentioned that you tried a few of them. Anything that stands out like why I didn't like this one.

0:50:29 Dhananjay kumar: I see. 
0:50:30 Vidhi Thakker: of the free to correct me if I'm wrong, but would you, would you say that suggestions around how. I don't know how to do that.
0:50:39 Vidhi Thakker: How. You can probably recover better. If you got all of them in a unified source, like from what I'm under.
0:50:47 Vidhi Thakker: Standing, you're having the problem with having too many sources of 
0:50:51 Dhananjay kumar: information. 
0:50:52 Vidhi Thakker: Yeah. When it comes to 
0:50:54 Dhananjay kumar: guidance. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. You Yeah. 
0:50:57 Vidhi Thakker: Do you think having a unified, uh, one-stop-shop kind of a thing, which knows, uuuh, which understands your routine, which could probably give you, like, a personal assistant, kind of a thing when it comes to your fitness.
0:51:11 Vidhi Thakker: Do you think that would be, something that might interest you? 
0:51:14 Dhananjay kumar: Yeah, so what it should have, like, my personal data, 
0:51:18 Vidhi Thakker: like, where I am. All 
0:51:19 Dhananjay kumar: right. What I enjoy, which they will put to say I enjoy all those things. That is from that it can give me.

0:51:29 Dhananjay kumar: suggestions. Yeah. Yeah. I have a background. I see. I should be. Yeah. And hoarding or what. Yeah. Better that to say I said today.
0:51:38 Dhananjay kumar: But if I have a neat pen or elbow pen or solar injury or something, what have those, But I will never trust the AI.
0:51:46 Dhananjay kumar: I see. That's my personal opinion because that's what I have experienced. Yes. And I will never suggest someone to go to the AI at this stage.
0:51:57 Vidhi Thakker: Er, I see. So if, It was a person doing this, would you feel more comfortable? Yeah. I 
0:52:05 Dhananjay kumar: mean, that person can use the AI at this and then it can feed back. Like, by 
0:52:11 Vidhi Thakker: evaluating the onset of AI. like the source of contact to be a human. Yeah. Yeah. 
0:52:18 Dhananjay kumar: I mean, I see. We should not, see, ecologically it is a, if you are trying to do. . . something, bringing on someone from one state to another state.
0:52:30 Dhananjay kumar: That person, come in. From a state A to a state B, psychologically, need a human touch. Or, You will not believe the AI, exactly.
0:52:42 Dhananjay kumar: Unless until they 
0:52:43 Vidhi Thakker: genji, like, they are very, 
0:52:46 Dhananjay kumar: how to say, correct. 
0:52:47 Vidhi Thakker: Okay. Yes, 
0:52:48 Dhananjay kumar: exactly. Risk taking. Yeah. Uh, they are exposed to that, but anyone older they are shouldn't. You will always have a doubt, 
0:53:01 Vidhi Thakker: or there will be initial assist. 
0:53:03 Dhananjay kumar: Just, just, just, distance to distance. 
0:53:10 Vidhi Thakker: Do you think? Thank you. I know you mentioned that being in a community is motivating. Especially if they are familiar 
0:53:19 Dhananjay kumar: faces. 
0:53:20 Vidhi Thakker: Uhh, so do you think elements, like, having streaks or, achievement, but, images or 
0:53:29 Dhananjay kumar: leaderboards, 
0:53:30 Vidhi Thakker: what do you 
0:53:31 Dhananjay kumar: feel about them? No, no. Do you think? Not for me, no, no. Hmm. 
0:53:36 Vidhi Thakker: Uh, any 
0:53:37 Dhananjay kumar: particular reason that you dislike them? Charity type of things, like if someone does more, so you don't have to take charity this much.
0:53:44 Dhananjay kumar: . . . That's another way of doing it, not motivating, but not bringing competition in this 
0:53:52 Vidhi Thakker: well-being. 
0:53:58 Dhananjay kumar: You can bring the well-being in a different way. Like, you can do the charity work. Thank you for watching. It will be in this minute, so many kilometers.
0:54:11 Dhananjay kumar: It's another way of putting the same thing. 
0:54:14 Vidhi Thakker: But not, 
0:54:16 Dhananjay kumar: let's jump. You know, fitness or something. That's a round of approach. Hmm. 
0:54:23 Vidhi Thakker: So, do you think, uh, Oh, more personal and self-paced things like 
0:54:28 Dhananjay kumar: maybe 
0:54:29 Vidhi Thakker: having a workout streak, like, safe. You're good. I used to work out three times a week. Yeah. And if you achieve that, then doing that is more helpful than, uh, competition among others.
0:54:43 Dhananjay kumar: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Again, you have to go into the age-based group, which age you're talking about, like. The younger generation will be much more complicated.
0:54:52 Dhananjay kumar: But, whenever for two, you'll be looking more to manage their health and- and 
0:54:57 Vidhi Thakker: I see. 
0:55:00 Dhananjay kumar: Hmmm. That's my opinion. I see. Okay. 
0:55:02 Vidhi Thakker: And, have you ever been for a fix now?
