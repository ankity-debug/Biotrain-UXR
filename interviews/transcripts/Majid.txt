0:00:27 No, this is much. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sorry. Hey girl. We'll in the one. None so good. None so good. We're trying to understand people's relationship with fitness, with how, and their body.
0:00:40 And how it fits into their daily life, what motivates them, what challenges them, and how is the U of any time.
0:00:50 So, before we start, I was going to let you know that there are no right or wrong ones. times. So, can you start?
0:01:04 Bye. By telling us a little about yourself, like your name, age and their occupation. Uh, actually, as you know, my name- My name is Majid.
0:01:14 I work here in UAE as a sales promoter, uh, in 2020, uh, before- I don't know either way. Mm-hmm. In a retail industry.
0:01:25 Uh, was- actually, I was like- much more in the sports like we used to play cricket. But, after I shifted here to U.E., uhh, there was no kind of- activity that time and it was like, uhh, corona season.
0:01:41 So, we'll just, like, eating junk forwards, no. Oh. You know, without thinking anything, we just, I just start eating, eating.
0:01:49 But while in corona, I just got calls from, . . . one interview and I try to be to get a job here anyway.
0:01:59 So that time, umm. 10 When I wear the formal shirt and I check myself, I was just completely changed, you know.
0:02:08 All right. I used to be, like, lean, much more fit person, but that day I realized, like, I'm just my- physical appearance is quite changed.
0:02:20 Because of the, uh, lifestyle I had here anyway. Just eating. Thank you. And just do the job and sleep. Like that kind of things.
0:02:29 That's the thing which, uh, struck in my mind. So I need to do- something regarding my fitness. So after that, I just be in, again, in, like, kind of, active in this.
0:02:42 But for me, like, I start hiking, running, these kind of things. As you mentioned that, How you will track your progress, what you do.
0:02:54 So then, because I didn't have any experience with the- . So I just joined a gym, uhh, and learned about, uhh, like the proper form proper- technique.
0:03:07 So for me, umm, the first thing is, you, and like in a short time, you will feel like- Thank you.
0:03:13 You know, there is something changes in yourself. Like, it should be some- you will feel it- there will be some feelings when you start, like, a fitness.
0:03:21 journey. Because, uhh, I'm not sure that you will get some kind of any kind of physical change. So, early, but, like, uhh, mentally, you will be much more focused.
0:03:34 You will, you will, confident level will be getting back. So. There will be this kind of changes you will feel, and, and a very quiet short time.
0:03:44 So, for the- You tracking things, like now, I'm almost more than two years. I do fitness, but I have a very busy schedule in my job.
0:03:53 Bye bye. Also, I do, like, around 9 to 10 hours job. But still, I hit, like, gym 3 to 4 days in a week.
0:04:01 and anyhow, and do my, uh, gym workout. But for gym, like, everyone has a different goal. Different- Umm, perspective about the fitness.
0:04:12 For me, I'm like more to the, uh, athletic form of workout. Code. For that one, I check, like, you know, to track my progress.
0:04:24 The main thing is I focus on the- Umm, load, like, if I continue to do progress in my intensity or volume, so it means- means.
0:04:33 I'm gaining some strength, I'm gaining some muscle and it's obviously I feel and I can see in the mirror as well.
0:04:42 For me, like, more problem comes to the nutrition part. Like, for the nutrition part, it's quite difficult for me. To track it.
0:04:52 For this one, I really believe there should be some systematic and a disciplinary, way to track your, uhh, what it's called, the nutrition pot.
0:05:03 You know, for everyone, I believe like this one. It will be the main problem. For that one, we need some kind of guideline, some kind of accountability, some kind of awareness to do.
0:05:14 To track more, uh, the nutrition board. For me, like, this kind of application or any kind of tracking app will- much more lubel and will help in the fitness industry.
0:05:27 For the normal, like, for the normal thing- things like if you track your progress in the gym, it's- we can do, like, you know, to check our volume, you know, and and density of the workout you do.
0:05:41 So, if you are a- if you are improving in that one, it's okay, you can get it. on the volume.
0:05:46 But still, if it's much more disciplined and much more consistent, I think the app will give much more better awareness and account.
0:05:54 Uhh, like, you know, you will be much more accountable for these things. You will do it better and it will make you and keep you motivated also.
0:06:04 So, um, so you mentioned getting a gen 3 to 4 times a week, right? Yes. Uh, so why are you watching my machine make-up mode at my panic-based workout for you?
0:06:20 Uh, actually, for me, I'm more focused on a compound exercise. . Uhh, like, umm, squads did live. I'm not going for any kind of isolation, because I'm not doing, like, a bodybuilding way, except size.
0:06:34 Just to get some huge muscle for me, I'll do by, like, roving, sprinting, uhh, running. on the running and also any alternative exercise like, uhh, jumping box, you know, any functional training.
0:06:51 Uhh, in also kind of, uhh, did live, it's a mention, all the compound exercise squats. Dead live, uhh, chest presses, shoulder presses, pull-ups, push-ups, and these rows, so these things is my- ehh, right now I'm doing like this.
0:07:08 Yes, before when I didn't have any kind of clue regarding this fitness, like, especially in the gym, I used- to do like, you know, the people normally usually do in the gym, like, one day each muscle, they train.
0:07:22 For me, like- it's not because I have a very hectic schedule, I am a very busy person, so I need something which can maintain my- uh, physics and, uh, I can get some endurance, uh, conditioning and strength, all the things.
0:07:38 please. So, this is my focus more on these things. For example, if I do, like, umm, squats, I will- do the front squats, umm, the main squats and lunges, and then I will do uhh.
0:07:54 Thank much. Printing these, those days and jumping box. So these, and I will do my stretching also to enhance my range of motion.
0:08:03 And my mobility of my muscles. Mm-hmm. I see. Uh, and how long have you been- working out for? And, uh, workout, it's almost now two years, uh, but, and then- time, like, there was- I was not much that much consistent, as I mentioned you, I didn't know about the gym how to perform a work, so I used to
0:08:26 go- I didn't know about the, like, this time I was a skinny, fat person, my belly was outside and I have no muscles.
0:08:35 So, what I have done, I stopped eating, because I know that I have fat, so I have a belly, so I need to remove this one, so I will not.
0:08:43 Eat properly. But it was something I had done a mistake, so, this is, after that when I realized I started learning.
0:08:52 And changed my own perspective about fitness. So, that's the thing. So, for me, like, in- the fitness industry, workload is the main thing, but the more part comes to the nutrition also.
0:09:06 For this one we- we really need something much more accountable in awareness and also a disciplinary action. If you do these things- .
0:09:15 We can do better. Mmm. And umm, would you say you have bent the routine? Do you? With your workouts on this point?
0:09:26 Sorry, sorry. Would you say you have now locked in on a routine? With your work. . No, I do work out because I used to wake up early in the morning so I will go to gym like I.
0:09:39 Bye. I do Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, Saturday. I can also, if I have a day off, I will go for a job.
0:09:48 So, if I have a free time, I will go do it without in the gym, but I will go in the pot.
0:09:55 So, What you're mentioning, working out at the gym, uhm, uhm, in outdoor areas as well, do you also, maybe, You work out at home, or a class or a studio that you wrote up.
0:10:09 Actually, here in the home, I cannot do because it's a small partition, so there is not that much space. But yes, in outside, if I run as, And then I will do some push-ups and bodyweight squats also.
0:10:25 But that depends, like, you know, Yes, yeah. But that depends, if I already uuhm, like, uhh. Umm, very intense workout the other day, so maybe I will take risk, and I will just do normal jogging, like normal walk.
0:10:50 Hello. Name. But even you don't like working at home would be the lack of space. Yeah, because uh. Soâ€¦ And the house is, we have the small partition, so it's, uh, especially in UAE, the people who are living in the partitions.
0:11:07 Uhh, there will be no space, so, uhh, it's, sometime it's okay you can do post shops, maybe squats, but keepin' on the side.
0:11:15 These of the, uhh, partition your living. Because here I'm talkin' very realistic and you, you're sitting in your living. You're in India.
0:11:25 Oh, we are currently based on India right now. So, in India and Pakistan we had houses with, which is large, big houses.
0:11:34 But here in UAE, if you have one apartment, so they make a small partition in that one. So, it's like an, one room, like, they will make two partition.
0:11:43 They will. Should they, not with congestion, I would say. Mmm. But it's outside we have, if we have such a weather like, now it's starting the winter.
0:11:55 Sir? You can do better in like, outside you can do it. There is a running track. There is parking. You can do work out there.
0:12:04 Also. Uh, you also mentioned the hiking, right? Mm-hmm. It's- I don't know. It's the hobby I have. Uh, I had done here in U.E.
0:12:16 also, uh, the highest mountain Jebeljish. Maybe, you know, I have- If you search about it, uhh, uhh, a different mountain here.
0:12:27 That was like a very- Green. Amazing experience and it's a hobby I have, I used to do in my country also.
0:12:32 Uhh, because it's- Yeah, it's like- connect you with the nature and you will feel like, you know, you're just from the very fast life and some- where in the peace.
0:12:48 And thank God to you, it's much more safe, even if you do in night also. It's also no problem. I see.
0:12:56 Um, what would you say is your biggest or- What they were talking about. I know you mentioned, uh, your health, your appearance, right?
0:13:07 Anything else? Yes! Let's go. It also helped me with the analogy. This one, uhh, the main thing is like, I- Bye.
0:13:16 One, two, look, you know, it's main thing is my appearance. And it all affects, like, you know, when you do work out, it all- affect you not only physically and affect you mentally as well.
0:13:29 When you perform in, in a, in a job like, you know. Your performance is also improving. If your physical fit or mental, your mental fitness will come automatically.
0:13:40 Your- confidence level will get improved. So, mean it's all well-being. It's not just only you do some physical workout or something like that.
0:13:49 So, I saw and I experienced the output from my work. So, I think- It's for everyone. It's a do for everyone.
0:13:59 Yeah, we got it. Hmm. Also. Uhh. Bye. And have there been times where you were not able to follow your routines?
0:14:10 I hate myself that time. Those, This is when I'm not going to go to gym or miss, like, maybe two times in a week.
0:14:20 What I will do, I will, if I have a two days in a week, so I will go, I will just split this 7-8 exercise, and I will do one day.
0:14:28 One and the next day another one. I see. So you trying to culture? Yeah, but you know, I really hate when I miss the gym.
0:14:36 Because I feel like, you know, something is missing in me. I see. And the stomach will. Umm. Then. And your oxygen to go follow any workout videos or tutorials or something.
0:14:51 Thank you. We see you in the next slide. Actually, before when I have no knowledge about these things, I used to check, like, uh, kind of application.
0:15:00 Actually, I think- I still haven't my vote. Uh, I don't know which kind of application is this one. Uh, let me search this.
0:15:08 is . application. It's one with the name of I muscle 2. I think it's available now in App Store. And one is workout because.
0:15:16 because that time I just know about like how the physical, uh, human anatomy work. Okay. We'll see you So these application I still have in my mobile.
0:15:29 I see. Um. So, we'll take a that. Okay, so, to that. What do you think, uhh, gets in your way of time to be consistent?
0:15:38 Like, umm, you launch in, you don't. Don't, like, nod onto the gym, right? For me, like, it's, you know. Go on.
0:15:49 They, they, they, they are saying, like, you know, I'm in a, in a industry, I'm where I'm working. It also teaches me.
0:15:57 If you are not consistent, you will not achieve. So, you need to be in a discipline. If you are not in a discipline.
0:16:05 You have to come out from your comfort zone. Because my work is like that. I have a target. Target. Every month to do.
0:16:14 I have no excuse to give to my, uh, boss to my manager. I have to do anyhow. I have to.
0:16:21 come out of the box and I have to do something like that. So that, that requires much more discipline, much more consistency and- no excuse.
0:16:30 If you have that kind of mind and it's like, see, we do a lot of things for our lives. Please.
0:16:37 But, the body is our mean, uhh, like, I mean, engine. If you are not taking care of our body, what, how, we- I will not be able to perform fully.
0:16:49 Like, for example, if I give you an example, you are in the mode or you are outside. side. Mm. And your mobile battery is run out.
0:16:55 It's getting switched off. What you will do. You will try to make sure to. oh you are mobile right now.
0:17:04 So if you can do all the things to get your mobile charge. Thank you much. Why not you do for yourself, for your body?
0:17:14 Just experience this is like, because this one had to happen with- I put all means to get charge my mobile, so if I can put all means to get in the shape.
0:17:25 Yep. And get a physical mental fit, so I can do it then. Yeah, definitely. some air cream. Umm, she's picking off, uh, come to get into shape on the inside.
0:17:39 What kind of metrics do you- you keep track of, like, do you track your sleep, maybe your heart rate, the kind of steps you're taking a due date.
0:17:49 That's what I told you, like, the application I'm using the watch, I'm using the garment. I'm going to watch, I'm using the Huawei watch.
0:18:00 Because I, I think the garment watch E.K.O.R.E.C. is much more, The dependable, you can depend on that one. But for this kind of tracking application, the main, the side effect comes to the, like, oh, easy.
0:18:16 Because you cannot, like, you know, sometime, for me, it's okay, I understand. But, The people who get more obsessed with this kind of application, it will be like, not too much enjoyable.
0:18:29 It will be, like, you know, stressed for such kind of people. Uki, maybe you, you will see, people will experience these things.
0:18:37 Have there too much, uhh, Obsessed with, because this is the side effects. First thing will be the echo AC. Like, how much we can depend on the echo AC of the tracking application.
0:18:46 Like, for example, I have a sandwich, and I click a picture, and I check the calories. But, uhh, it's okay.
0:18:53 It will give me- like around 600 calories. But, like, which matrix they use to give you the 600 calories? Is it accurate?
0:19:01 Go right. Or no. You cannot, like, fully, completely, depend on these things. Yeah. So for me. If you eat, like, like, I'm not eating junk food, like, no burger, no pizza, uhh, no artificial- She'll see you sugar.
0:19:18 So, I'm not eating these things. So, if I'm not eating these things and I'm not eating too much processed food, okay, if I eat too much other food, it's okay, no- no problem.
0:19:27 Maybe that will be a protein content will be more. So, if I eat chicken, it's okay, no problem for me.
0:19:33 Thank you. Yes, I like, uh, do check the portion of fries, maybe a roti or the bread. So. Boom. Depends.
0:19:43 But the honest part is regarding this kind of, because I have the watch when I'm running on the treadmill. Or I'm checking the highest my heart rate.
0:19:54 Uh, I'm not fully, like, depend on this one, but at least it give me- give me some guideline. It's okay.
0:20:00 I'm going in the right right. Because if I want to check my highest, uh, heart rate, maximum heart rate. So, I mean, if I sprint, like, in the fastest way, so how can I track my heart rate.
0:20:13 Good. It will give me, but, umm, I am not dependable, fully dependable, and I could race you that much. But it's a guideline, it's ok.
0:20:22 It's something good also. And use for the step counting, it's also good thing. At least when I check every day, I'm hitting.
0:20:30 More than 10,000 m. I'm happy. It's the something small. I feel like I have done. I want something and it give me make.
0:20:38 Thinking and keeping me consistent. Never sounds all for achievement. Mm hmm. I see. Thank you very much. Umm, so you mentioned, you don't like to check on the high pay date, even though you're not sure.
0:20:54 No. Why do you think that is like, do you like seeing, uhh, your average heart rate of the day or the day?
0:21:02 You like, like I know you mentioned the steps thing, right? It feels like a sense of achievement. What would you say about the heart rate?
0:21:10 The portion of it, or the calories, how do you feel about that? These are the small things which keep you consistent and- In like, it's make you excitement also.
0:21:20 It's- That's what I'm saying. For me, like, I feel it. It's not- Okay, maybe it's completely 100% eco- Echo. So at least I can still get some guideline from this kind of- application or the- Yes, it's a good idea.
0:21:38 I can get idea from this one. So something is better than nothing at least- I'm just, uhh, you know, keeping on track that I'm okay.
0:21:47 10,000, it's okay. More than 10,000 is plus point for me also. Umm, I see, I see. And, oh, do you have any specific limitations?
0:21:58 I'm a patient. Or any health conditions? No, no, no, no. Nothing. Nothing. That affects the way you approach, uh, your workouts, right?
0:22:10 No, no, no, no. Okay. Thank you. Uh, so you mentioned, your diet, uh, and following a diet. So what is your current focus of your, diet?
0:22:25 Diet means, like, my eating habit and I hold it in. I'm not following any specific diet, so I have to eat that one, I have to eat because, you know, because, see, I have no- I am to cook for me.
0:22:40 If I can cook, I will cook only maybe the eggs or the sandwich, that's it. But, what I will check.
0:22:47 Okay, I need that much protein. Okay, I will just have the chicken and I will just make the portion very limited.
0:22:54 Like, if I have a- Nice or maybe bread or roti. Mm, nice. But that's what, you know, I actually want to try this one.
0:23:02 But the main thing is- I told you the accuracy is the matter. Mm. Like for example, if I'm using any application and I- click a picture because there is no other way only you have to click a picture and it will give you like all that much calories and that one that much protein is that one, right?
0:23:18 Mm. Mm-hmm. Or there is any other way that you can calculate, uhh, getting an idea about this one. Not only you will click a picture- picture and you will upload an application, right?
0:23:31 So this one is, I believe it will be a- good idea for guideline and give you some awareness. I see.
0:23:42 But like- So fully accuracy, uhh, I'm not sure. Because you need to check. So what do you just say instead of following a structured line?
0:23:56 You just try to eat healthier and try to eat better. I'm watching a portion. I said. And, like, what? Like, for me, I'm not eating.
0:24:07 you eating too much rice, maybe rice, in a week twice. That's it. But, not too much. Maybe, like, umm, what I would say.
0:24:15 there. Maybe, like, uhh, in school, I can calculate like this because I don't know how many grams I cannot say like that.
0:24:23 That's the first. Oh, good, yeah. All right. Got it. And here, a routine maybe I will have two routine. Mm-hmm.
0:24:30 But that's, that's. That's enough. But the rest, maybe I will focus more on the wedge and the fruits. That's it.
0:24:37 Mm-hmm. I see. Or whatever. Or the chicken or any other fish or any meat, something like that. Mm-hmm. I was- So you mentioned that one of the main reasons you can't do me follow that is that you don't have enough time to cook for yourself.
0:24:56 Right? Uh-huh. So what does your usual meal situation that you like? Will you meal prep before, huh? on. Do you just make fresh food every day?
0:25:07 Like, what does it look like? Actually, I'll just go to any- In nearby restaurant, and the main thing is, if I will check, like, what is the- if I will go for- grill chicken, or charcoal chicken.
0:25:22 If not, then I will check any kind of soup with a chicken. Mmm. And then with the salan. and we'll see you And yes, the routine.
0:25:30 Because see, uhh, I mentioned in the first set, I'm not doing like, bodybuilding. . And type of exercise. Yeah. For me, I really need a cause.
0:25:40 Because I have 9 hours standing job. And using my energies. So I need like, carbs also. So, for this one, I'm eating like, roti more.
0:25:52 And- And the brown bread. Mm-hmm. But rice maybe will like, very rare I will eat rice in a week 2 times.
0:26:00 Maybe. I see. So what do you say of main motivation for eating better would be? We'll see the next one.
0:26:08 Hold, or maybe need a big management, maybe an OG or a performance. What would you say? For energy, same. The main thing is, if you eat.
0:26:24 Well, you will get energy. Mm. And if you rest well also. Definitely. Obviously, if you have a good risk, I'm talking a- How about risk?
0:26:33 I'm not talking about if you sleep 10 hours, 8 hours and you wake up and you still feel fatigue or not risk.
0:26:39 Believe me, maybe sometime I will- sleep for 5 hours but I will be much more productive and active than my 8 hours sleep.
0:26:47 So, for me- Like, if you deep sleep, like, if you sleep for 5, 6, okay, I will do 6 to, uh, 6 hours.
0:26:55 Bye-bye. And it gives you the, when you wake up and you feel energetic and much more productive the whole day, that's enough.
0:27:03 But for that one, yeah. Because you need to eat well. I'm not, you know, because I'm talking about very realistic because I'm giving you my example.
0:27:12 on the product one. Like a common person. I'm not like showing you something luxury things that I'm doing. Like this, I'm like this.
0:27:22 I believe me. I'm just eating out from outside. I'm doing 10 hours job, which including 1 hours. Like, the transportation also.
0:27:32 So, and I have a job, and then I maintain like this kind of things. So I, It's possible. But the main thing is the consistency and the discipline.
0:27:41 If you just remove some kind of junk fast food. And processed food and artificial sugar. Just the main thing you will have, you will see the difference.
0:27:52 Also. Yeah. And then if you try to eat good, then it's enough. Not too much oily things. things. 7 8 But if someone is a professional, is a bodybuilder.
0:28:09 Or he want to give, like, 24 hours. So these things, obviously he will cook for himself. He have a hard.
0:28:16 I'm sorry. Different regiment, like, he have a different plan, everything. But if someone is just, like, how, how a guy works.
0:28:25 . In the office, like, I work in the module. For him, I think it will be difficult for him to follow these kind of things.
0:28:31 If he do everything for himself. Yeah, I do, I do. Umm, so have you ever worked with a nutritionist? I'm going to stop.
0:28:41 Or a dietitian. Maybe a trainer who helps you try to go to eat better. book. Yes, uhh, actually I'm going to get the certification of nutrition also.
0:28:55 I don't mean, I'm going to get the personal trainer certification also. It's almost in the final. But still, I told you, I do not like a professional and uh, and, and, and I, 24, like, it's not my job.
0:29:11 My job is different, but it's, I like to- learn things. Because now I'm in this industry. I do just as a hobby, not as a my profession.
0:29:20 I'm not like- doing just as a profession, but it's my hobby to learn and apply on myself. Then maybe if I do as a profession, so maybe I- I will help people better.
0:29:31 No. I'll see. But yes, nutrition- I play a very important role in the fitness in a healthy life. So, I'll see.
0:29:44 Thank you. And, umm, would you say you'll work out, affect your diet or your diet affects your workout? Bump. No, no, I didn't see anything like that.
0:29:55 I said, if you eat 12, you rest 12, obviously you will see the result. Yeah, yeah. Uhh, definitely. Uhh, what I'm going to ask is, if do you think nutrition is more?
0:30:09 Got him. For me, I think I would prefer more nutrition. Thank you. See you soon. In workout, if also, like for example, if I do is, is a, is a.
0:30:25 profession, if I, my job is a, is a, is a profession like is in a gym or in a fitness industry, the more important is in a.
0:30:33 Uts situation, so uuuh, in some workout, yes, workout is also important but. It's maybe play 30% role and 70% for nutrition.
0:30:47 chart. Yeah. Mm. I see. Because if you use your body, but you're not putting something in it which it requires and it needs.
0:30:56 Thanks. Bye. There will be no progress, there will be no growth. Hmm. Awesome. Thank you much. Umm, umm, do you lose any health supplements like vitamins, multivitamins, maybe protein, in your diet?
0:31:12 Well, I I started- recently, because I was a better reluctant to use these kind of things, but, You know, then I, umm, research by myself also.
0:31:28 It's okay, it's a good thing if it's umm, a good brand and you're buying some, umm, authentic source. Oh, then it's, it's good.
0:31:36 So I'm using wear proteins. I started recently creatine also. And I'm using, like, multivitamin also. Hmm. Mm. So, just recently started that one.
0:31:48 What do you say your experience has been so far with them? I'm I would say about the creatine, creatine is the best thing is, because I see much more growth in my- hmmm.
0:32:04 So, because, uhh, I think it gave me more power. I feel like, you know, before if I- do shoulder press 15, now I'm almost on 25 kg each camera like dumbbell.
0:32:16 So, I feel like more power- All right. When I go to the workout, I never use free workout. I never use any kind of things, other things.
0:32:25 We'll see you It's an Thanks. You're welcome. Before I go, maybe I will have some black coffee with one bread.
0:32:30 And maybe two, three dates. That's it. And after- 30, 40 minute, I will go do workout. But I think this kriya teen enhanced the power.
0:32:40 I feel like that. I see. I see. I see. And, umm, you mentioned you heard a bit stop at all before starting the house of lemons, right?
0:32:50 Okay. Is there any reason? Because, uh, see, uhh, it's our body. We need to take care. If you're putting something and I have no idea, you know, maybe for me, my mind will not accept it.
0:33:06 And I will be not satisfied until unless I check by myself. Because, you know, you know the gym culture. Maybe, you, you're in India, maybe you'll see.
0:33:17 And the guy just knew to the gym how the, you know, unprofessional. fish. People guide them in a very wrong way.
0:33:26 So for this one, like, now what is we are just one step away from. You somebody search you can do it by yourself, hmmm.
0:33:35 Although these are the things which makes me like, you know, uh, let me f- research but in uuuh, thank god it's like much more organized and there is not that much that someone will do something wrong.
0:33:46 I'm going to never, there is like all the sources will be authentic and you can buy from it. Mhm, awesome.
0:33:53 Thank so much. Umm, do you think I mean those maybe apps or featureable routines could help you m- image or mutation button?
0:34:05 Till now, honestly I didn't use, but is, in this not, I mention, I want- I cannot try these things, but uhh, that the main thing which stopped me, because I think there is one guy, I am- following him, it's a gym, I think, he has also an application.
0:34:23 But I didn't try here, because what, uhh, stopped me- is the accuracy. But yes, it will be in a good guideline and awareness regarding nutrients.
0:34:36 But yes, maybe in the future I will try also. Um What I was there was an app that would help to load the back programs to you, like say it better than me for- Alright, bye.
0:34:56 or if you're traveling, or if you're working. It's adjusting to your study, your time. Do you think that already helped you?
0:35:04 See, this is the limitation of, this kind of application. The limitation is, for example, every individual has a different goal, has a different body composition.
0:35:15 It is a different approach. So, it will be better if the application do and cuss, optimize regarding the individual requirement rather than in a general he apply the, ehm.
0:35:32 So, these are the things which made me stop not to take the application. If there is an application, vote Taylor.
0:35:38 Good luck. Or customize you, the plan. It's good. It's- it's something, uhh, person should try. Maybe, uhh. Good. Good. It's- it's get- good, uhh, result also.
0:35:50 Mmm. I see. So if, uhh, there was an app that- world tailor, say, using AI or something, if they were making proper meal recommendations to you.
0:36:03 . . a time in everyone, u then, that would haint being means or no, may be a structure die. Obviously, if this, like, for example, if I gave my, uhh, routine, the daily routine, I put everything there, and then he cus- I mean, every should, everyone should try that one also.
0:36:30 It's not only just for uhh, effectiveness, uhh, professional, I think normal, common people. People also need it. Mm-hmm. I see.
0:36:40 And uhh, you mentioned trying with a couple of fitness. No, no, no. That time, because it's still in my phone.
0:36:51 on the, So it will show you the, uh, physical, uh, human anatomy, how it works, how to do workout. Well, could you help me with the name of the app that you had mentioned?
0:37:13 Uhh, yes. It's, I think, no more in, The Play Store, because it's available now workout with the name of workout.
0:37:21 Mm-hmm. And, I muscle too. Mm-hmm. Actually, this application gave you the structure of, a human's body.
0:37:34 Mm-hmm. How the muscle, the name of the muscle, the skeletal muscle, like the name? Because of these kind of, uhh, things you will get in this one.
0:37:43 Mm-hmm. I see. Or any- Any reason that you particularly chose these apps? No, because I search on the- Umm, Play Store and App Store, so which application is available, so I just learn about these things.
0:38:01 Uh, it games on the top, so I just download it. I see. Me, the recently I didn't check by the way, but maybe there will be more new application added.
0:38:11 It is. Add to App Store and Play Store, or maybe some other, uhh, you know, sources, maybe on YouTube, but on the- I've stored it for almost now two years ago, I downloaded it.
0:38:24 I see. And uhh, do you- I've known anything about what the app was like. Maybe any feature that you found were very helpful back then.
0:38:36 Maybe, uhh, the main thing was how to do workout, like, you know, what is the name of the muscles. Mmm, I see.
0:38:44 And do you really help you with the actual workout? Yeah, because, uhh, actual workout, no. Because it doesn't show you how to do- Because, before there was, uhh, that time was another application, they just now enhanced for that to know you.
0:39:00 We have to pay. I think that application is the one I must sell to. I show you the names. The, that one is the one I think it show you how to do the- uhh, you know, proper exercise.
0:39:12 I see. Do you think that would help? OK. Okay? Or it would be helpful right now. I don't know if I don't like a loaf of nuts.
0:39:20 See, umm. It's- Hello. Someone have no reach to any, uhh, and a real human coach. And he is- No time or something like that.
0:39:35 Believe me, this application, if it do it, it- it's more than enough for a person. So, to use that kind of application.
0:39:43 Rather than go to gym and do something, you know, some silly exercises, even it- doesn't know what is it's for and what is the correct techniques and form.
0:39:52 Rather than using this kind of platform, it helps and it's a good guy. I'm not saying it's fully, you know, uh, productive, but still we need like.
0:40:03 Thank you. It's somehow, it's, uh, play an important role for someone like me when he's just like. Can I join the gym?
0:40:11 I don't know anything how to- to work out. Even I didn't know the names of the machine. How and how I'd use it.
0:40:19 So maybe this- This is a good, like, a kind of, uh, uh, uh, knowledge for someone who are new or maybe- Oh.
0:40:28 He is also advanced in the gym, but still he needs something to use it. Okay. Bye. Thank you guys so much.
0:40:36 Umm, umm, umm, anything that you remember has been frustrating about the app. No, actually the frustration was that, that what I wanted, I wanted to learn the proper exercise, like.
0:40:52 For example, if I do any chest press, how I will do it, which machine I need to use it, because there is a lot of machines.
0:41:00 Smith machine. I didn't know how to use it, and what is the name, and what it is for. So at least, if there is an- And if, application, who even tell about this specific muscle will be targeted, and this is the name of the machine, and you can use- this one for this outcome.
0:41:19 I think it will be helpful for the person. awesome. Awesome. Oh, did you ever seem overwhelmed or pressured by the app?
0:41:31 Bye bye. You know, obviously if you spend that much time and it's, you'd not- get the desired result you want or the outcome.
0:41:44 So obviously it will be a kind of frustration and stress. Mm. Come here. Definitely. Umm, umm, you mentioned having the guide when you watch and they're reading, right?
0:41:56 Okay. Uh-huh. Uh, what, how was that experience from life? Like, I know you mentioned you didn't know it. I'm sorry.
0:42:05 It was accurate or not, but other than that, how has the tracking been working out? What are your thoughts on that?
0:42:12 No. Go! Because for me, the Garmin, I feel like much more accurate than the other watch. I didn't experience Apple, but I have Garmin, uh, check the- What?
0:42:21 I mean, both are very good, but I believe more in the Garmin. Yes. Because, you know, when you do- fours.
0:42:29 Sprinting or running or jogging, it can show you, like, much more. There is a different and, like, maybe, for example, my- maximum heart rate is going 182, 186, 180.
0:42:42 Maybe in the Hawaii watch, it will show, like, 182. See you too. But in the garment, it will show 174 or 180.
0:42:50 So means I still have, I still have to- And I can add intensity in the sprinting or running to get my maximum heart rate.
0:43:00 So this somehow- I'm hot. I may- I just check in the garment. Then I search about the garment that yes, the garment watch accuracy you can use like.
0:43:09 Bye. And specially for the fitness industry. It's much more like, you know, the people in the fitness industry and they are- much more can trust on the government much than the other ones.
0:43:21 Hmm. I see. Bye. I don't know. Umm, umm. Coming to the topic of tracking again, when you look up at the gym, do- you know, not bound, uh, exercising your going, the weights, maybe the steps that you're doing.
0:43:40 You know? Before I didn't use that one, but when I'm not, when I wasn't using that one, I, sometime, you know, when you have no plan and you go, to gym and then it's like a waste of time that you go gym and then you're thinking, for 10 minutes, now what should, I do, so then what I have done, actually
0:44:02 I plan a program card for myself. So this is the back there. Yes, yes, yes. So I have a program.
0:44:13 program. Because, you know, the main thing is the time savings. So it saved my time and from the next day, like, you know, F.
0:44:21 Finish the workout today. The next day, it is already automatically in my mind that tomorrow I have that workout. And I am ready.
0:44:29 I am like. I am completely ready. If you are ready, so no problem. You will go. You will do the dynamic stretching, wamam.
0:44:37 So, for that. Particular exercise. Rather than going gym, uhh, 10 minute, 5 minutes, okay. I will do this exercise. side.
0:44:45 For that and I will do this kind of stretching. No, it's like a wasting of time. But I, I used to do, I was like, you know, and, and I re- realize, no, this is the kind of wasting of my time also.
0:44:57 This is also a good thing that you need to be. Also, in a plan. Planning is the main thing, which cause it keeps you safe, you save the time and make- So.
0:45:10 You're consistent and keep you in discipline. Umm, can you know how some, uhh. up. They collect your data or maybe share your data.
0:45:23 How do you generally feel about that? . See, if you are talking about the fitness application, they are collecting the data.
0:45:33 done. The main thing is, the person who is putting the data, it should be smart enough, what is his cool.
0:45:41 hmm. So, like, as I mentioned for you, we are going to the gym. You know, maybe the gym culture. Everyone is, like, do post.
0:45:50 And the mirror in the front of mirror. And they just want to be like, normally they are doing like a bodybuilding style.
0:45:57 It's a good sport. But everyone should know that, what is his goal, what he want to achieve. For me, like, I was.
0:46:06 I was like, I-I know what is my goal, I don't want to be a bodybuilder. So, I don't want to waste my time in this kind of kind of thing.
0:46:15 So, I want to be in athletic. I want to be in Europe. I want to focus more strength, speed, these kind of things.
0:46:21 Yes, hype out to- we have to work out like compound exercise. It's enough for me. So, everyone should know what is his goal and occur- Thank you.
0:46:31 He can put his data and what he wants to achieve, like in 3 months, 6 months, 1 year. So, he can put that- one, according to these kind of, uhm, planning.
0:46:43 Rather than just putting data, sitting in- like, and just putting data in the application. But he should know his, uhh, his level of fitness as well.
0:46:54 but like, what is his fitness level. Then he can go for the, even maybe the apps, the application can ask the question.
0:47:02 Thank you so much for your attention. Like, what is your goal? What is your main goal to achieve? What is your body fat percentage?
0:47:10 You wanna- Uhh, wanna make- gain muscles. And what is your workout should look like? Mmm. Good. All right. I'm here.
0:47:18 I need can help All right. Can you help me? Umm, so, What will do? No. What kind of questions would you be willing to answer?
0:47:31 Like, for example, if there was an- that is asking you to share maybe, maybe your blood reports so that it can help give you a better to determine.
0:47:42 In addition on your diet and your workout, do you think that is something you would be ok with? You Uhh, I think the blood report we need to check, like if there is, uhh, if it's a normal, healthy person, it's ok, I think the blood- blood report will be not required.
0:48:01 You know, until unless, yes, for nutrition, if you uhh, like, suggest. Yes? Are giving some kind of specific nutrition. I think he should just visit a doctor or maybe- babies.
0:48:15 somehow he has no kind of any kind of chronic diseases or any kind of sickness or any kind of allergic- How did you, from some kind of foods?
0:48:25 I think these questions should be asked from the individual. Sure. Umm. Didn't you, didn't you can suggest? Yeah. Yeah. Like some, I'll tell you one more thing.
0:48:41 I think if it's someone who is a low sugar, and if you just tell him not to eat in too fast, What do you think?
0:48:48 What with that guy? Yeah. So these kind of, For example, say in the blood reports, you can see that you have, less of, maybe, omega 3, or vitamin C, or something like that.
0:49:08 And then it's making small changes and not die too, Adjust and compensate for that deficiency. Wouldn't that be helpful? Yes.
0:49:19 Thank joining us. See, like, this one, if you suggest any kind of, uh, maybe some supplement are rich. Shh. Umm, like F omega 3 is deficiency.
0:49:31 You can suggest any kind of, uh, food or any kind of- meat which is rich in omega 3. But before that one, you suggest any kind of dietary change and then- and individual.
0:49:44 You make sure, like, for me, I- I will make sure that if I have some kind of problem, like, sugar, l I will be something and I have other some kind of chronic disease or anything like that.
0:49:57 I need to check these things also. So and- and I have to ask also these kind of things. If someone comes with such kind of, uh, sicknesses, that is, you can even, uh, enhance.
0:50:07 The, uh, a good diet, it's okay if it's deficient of any vitamins. Dr. Munz. Manrolls. You can just, you know, uh, what it's called.
0:50:19 Introduce that kind of rich food which is, uh, helped. The individual to achieve the goal. But still I told you, but still I told you, it should be tailored according to the individual and it should be customized regarding his need is in the requirement.
0:50:38 Hmm. Mm hmm. I see. Or how much would you trust an AI's recommendation? and ocean. Sorry. So, for example, say, those and all of you are talking about where, It's helping you customize your, uhh, diet plan and workout plan according to your schedule and your time.
0:51:03 Do you? I think you will trust an AI recommendation for tailoring your plan. Come on. Uhh, yes, but see, you know, by using AI, it also needs to give a proper, uhh, uhh, from to the AI to get the top desired result.
0:51:25 If you are not able to express yourself to the, AI, I think it will not give you the your desired uhh, answer.
0:51:34 Also. See ya. But it's really, I told you, it's a really good thing. If someone use it, it's, it's really nice thing.
0:51:44 Because at least the individual will get some kind of guideline, awareness, and any kind of. This hat that Look at that.
0:51:52 Umm, like, you know, if he doesn't know anything, at least he will get something, some knowledge also. It should be much more knowledgeable also.
0:52:00 Umm, um, have you ever paid for a fitness, uhh. You have maybe a subscription or any related service? Uhh, not here, but.
0:52:16 I'm using like a, uhh, paid because it's my requirement of my job and my lifestyle. time. So, I'm asking question regarding my fitness as well.
0:52:28 But, is I mentioned to you earlier, uhh. . . I'm much more keen to get some knowledge. That's what I started as a personal fitness trainer.
0:52:39 So, I paid for it. So, I'm learning that one also. And it's for the nutrition because it's also a good certification and it's, it's.
0:52:48 . It's like, you know, something you have, everyone should have, like, something about the diet. I'm just trying to get- this one.
0:52:57 If I get an application which have this kind of information and this kind of guideline, it- it will be the better, nor rather- then getting the certificate, maybe I can use that one also.
0:53:08 So if there was an application like that. you Do you think you would pay for it? Uh, yes, we can see.
0:53:19 Depends on the person. Umm, of profession, like, if some, because, you know, I have seen people, they are paying high amounts for, like, for workout session.
0:53:31 So, if they have this kind of application, I think, depend on the market. Okay. By the way, hmmm. So, people are paying.
0:53:42 Uh, how much? I'm talking about the- And we'll see you in Sorry. How much would you be willing to pay?
0:53:50 You know, here, the people- Well, For one-hour session, they're paying around 100 to 150 the rounds. So, one-hour session for workout session.
0:54:02 So, you think that nutrition is much more, uh, clean and important- and the, uh, fitness- maybe they can pay more, more than that one, depend like, it's a 3 months, it's lifetime, it's a parm- Pardon me.
0:54:16 It depends. And also depend on the application, what kind of services they are providing. We'll in the next video. Hmmm, better.
0:54:28 Uhh, so say it was providing on the, so this is the adjustment. You know their recommendations and nutrition aspect, they work out as well.
0:54:38 What kind of a payment, uhh. What method would you practice? Like, do you want it? Would you want it to be your one-time payment thing?
0:54:47 Maybe a month, things upset. Thank you. Or do you just have to pay, like, okay, if I want to tailor my direct plan?
0:54:56 I will. You know. We pay for that. Or if I only want to work out plan, I will only pay for that.
0:55:02 No, if we talk about the business, it's- I'm sorry, it could be very smart way. So, for example, like as an application, if I do it, I will do it like, uhm.
0:55:13 I will give the option of one month, three months, six months, and one year. Because, see, you need to be, uh, flexi- See you video.
0:55:21 Well, with the customer, not too much, put too much pressure on the client. If it's okay, if the customer get the desire.
0:55:29 I'm not sure in one month he will get the whole result, but at least he will feel the changes what that is following.
0:55:37 This is, I'm 100% sure if he's following 10 days, he will get the desired feelings and the result. So- If he is willing, then he can go for 3 months, he can go for 6 months, and he can go for 1 year.
0:55:52 But there should- Thank you. Like, 1 month- 1 month also, because it should be flexible. It shouldn't be not much put pressure on the client that he can- not, like, some people may be, like, for example, me, if I'm not able to pay for the 3 months, because the fees will be higher.
0:56:07 Oh, then I will say, okay. Let me- try for the 1 month. If it give me the result or some good vibes, maybe I'll go for the- 3 months.
0:56:18 Because here, see, you need to tailor normally the workout plan the people are making. It's like around 12 weeks. Like 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.
0:56:29 So they want to see, like, if, if someone is already in, in a- and he wants to check his, umm, result, maybe he will give, like, he will go to the trainer, he will ask, I want in 3 months.
0:56:41 This result, okay, I will give you 3 months workout, and he can check, okay, I have 3 months, I have to follow the, uhh, nutrition also.
0:56:49 For that result. And so it should be like this, like, 1 month, it's okay, it should be flexible, option is there, and then 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.
0:56:58 I see. Um, umm, how old are you this time? Bye. So, when you think of being, uhh, sick or holy, what does that mean to you personally?
0:57:14 That I should be able to do any kind of physical activity, umm. I don't want to. And my mental health and all well being should be normal, not below the, that I'm not doing anything.
0:57:29 And I have some kind of this one, and I can get any kind of pressure, it's mentally and physically. See you later.
0:57:37 Umm, because when we do any kind of workout, we are putting pressure, so we, umm, like, you know, maintain keep resist to that workout.
0:57:48 So it should be also affecting our mental health as well. So that we should survive and very, . Like any kind of stressful situation also.
0:57:58 Like it's like, it's, it's, it's like a c- conditioning you, you, you, you just condition yourself for all kind of all possible, you know, worse scenario.
0:58:09 and that's it. your, uh, things you will face in the future. I see. Um, um, how- how do you describe your current level of activity or overall health right now?
0:58:25 So let's see here. And what's going See, that's what I told you. Uh, if I give, I will not go for more, but if I rank myself, it's, I'm 7x.
0:58:33 Bye! 10. Okay. So, because there is some, which I'm laking, I told you. you are. Sometime I'm not getting proper sleep.
0:58:45 Because of my work. But if there is someone. one. Who is just doing a good job and they have not that much.
0:58:54 But for me, if uhh, regarding the fitness. Uhh, I'm quite well. I can, you know, it's around 5 hours hiking I had done from.
0:59:06 them. One side and then 5 hours hiking from the other side. I think I could give myself 10x10 but I will just maintain it in the normal 7x10.
0:59:15 Because if you do hiking in my, my is not like that much, uh, winter season here in New York. It's also very summer feeling you will feel.
0:59:26 So, if you do hiking in my, eh. And 5 hours, just maybe 10 minutes, you will do the pose and then you will start again, carrying almost.
0:59:38 Like, dinky gee, thing so. I think I'm free. I think. Uhh. Oh many think of other people who are safe.
0:59:51 What comes to our mind? angle. See, for me, like, it's different. I-I mentioned for you. If someone can walk to- 30 minutes.
1:00:04 I think for me, it's fit. Regularly. I think it's fit because I have seen people with big bodies. You have bit muscle.
1:00:12 If you let them to sprint for 22nd, and they will not catch their breath. It's okay, it's look, it's look.
1:00:18 It's fit, but in reality, in real life, it's different. For me, I want to be like this. If I run- Like, if I walk, like, 6 hours, 7 hours, carrying some things, uh, I don't want myself to be- Good.
1:00:39 That's what, you know, I mentioned in the start that I'm- much more an athletic way of work-out, rather than to be a bodybuilding workout.
1:00:48 Also. So- Thank so much. Do you think fitness is more about enjoyment, structure, uhh, having a balance- discipline also? Oh I think it's the best version of yourself.
1:01:05 Mm. Mm. I see. And have there been times that you were not able to creep off the care routine? Like, I don't know my- And we understand that you were not able to keep up.
1:01:20 a little. Like, uhh, maybe when last time I went on vacation, yeah. I didn't do any kind. Bye. Instead of physical activity and I just may be walking in my home country because, uhm, busy with the people.
1:01:37 That's all. Go ahead. It's okay, you need some time, uhh, it's okay. But, but for me, I, I hate even the- is situation where- and I don't go even for walking or jogging.
1:01:51 So, I need to do just even if I'm not doing work out. But in the gym, I should go for sprinting and for walk.
1:01:57 Well, um, in these situations do you wrestle, if you're tired, or maybe, uhh, like, would you still want to- I don't know.
1:02:12 If yes, then would you want it to be tailored to your parent's scenario? Like, oh, I'm back home. I'll be more de la- It's on my diet.
1:02:20 Something with that. See, if I'm in sedentary situation, if I'm doing nothing, I'm not doing any kind of physi- electrical activity.
1:02:28 Yes, I need to check my diet also, rather than let's just enjoy the food. Because I'm not doing any kind of activity.
1:02:35 Maybe just a normal light walk. It's okay. But still I need to check. So, that time maybe I will just, reduce some calories.
1:02:44 Mm. That's it. That's it. I'll do it. And maybe less I've got, I'm sorry. Mm. I smell. Do you think, uh, looking at your own progress?
1:02:58 else. Is your biggest motivator? Or listening to the feedback maybe from your trainer, or your candies? Like which one? on do you think is not accepted?
1:03:10 Actually both can help to a person, because see, when, when you are not See feeling some insight, a thousand people will say, maybe it's okay somehow, some point you will accept it.
1:03:23 But when you go get alone and the feelings coming from inside, if it's not matching, I think it is not that much.
1:03:30 It will not keep you motivating. It should both way also, but I am 100% sure Madam, if you are feeling from inside, the people will say it, it, it should reflect the- on your, your face and your body should appearance will change everything.
1:03:45 So, these things, yes, if someone- give you a good complemented circle. It means it's working and you need to keep it up.
1:03:54 Mmm. And, I see. Umm, so which one would you say more reflecting the progress of the, feedback from our beliefs?
1:04:05 For yourself? I'm sure I'm taking both. Even if the people are saying, And I'm not performing properly in the gym, so it's not good for me.
1:04:16 So, if I see okay, I'm doing progress in the workout. So, and the people are saying good thing, it means it's working both ways.
1:04:24 Hmm. I see. Because, because you know. You see, if the people are saying, and you already get in shape, and you are not doing any progress.
1:04:35 And you just stop it. So, people will say for how many months, maybe for one, two months. But, if you're not keeping it up, if you're not pushing.
1:04:43 You yourself for that one. You're not progressing in that one. Then it's, you know, not good also. Just the people will only.
1:04:51 I'll leave. You see. And, um, coming back to the, uh, app that we were speaking about. What? Say if it gave you notifications, like, oh, it's your time to work out now.
1:05:06 Or, oh, why don't you- I have no dinner right now, so that you have three hours, you know, about just something like that.
1:05:13 Do you think those random notifications would be am I? So, you know what they actually will be helpful for you.
1:05:24 The application should be much more flexible. Like, for example, if I get the notification. . You should eat now, and I'm in, uhh, some important work or a meeting.
1:05:37 It's maybe un-ignful, but it's a good also for, For me, it should be like the notification should be reflecting like this.
1:05:45 Okay, this is your time. So, from this time, that time you need to finish your dinner. So that you have, uhh, almost two hours, one and a half hours before you sleep.
1:06:01 So it can, should be, like, a kind of flexibility. So we need this kind of application. We need the application to make it more enjoyable, not more stressful.
1:06:11 Thanks for watching. Like it's become like you, it's like a person individual version and the application form. And see you you customize and tailor like that.
1:06:22 It's an amazing. For example, I'll give you one more example. You're with your- family somewhere outside visiting somewhere and your application, you're busy with your family gathering and your- the application is beeping notification like that.
1:06:38 What do you like to take it is, uhh, positive way or a negative way? So, these are the things. So, it should be like flexible.
1:06:48 So, you need to finish your dinner in this, uhh, time ratio. So, in this timeline, so that you have, like, it's something good, it should be everything positive way.
1:06:58 Oh I agree. Umm, so, coming back to the whole thing, back to the mother's. Thanks. No? No? Sorry. I'm, I do alone.
1:07:23 Before I use the- I'll let you know. I have with my friend but now because I shifted to another place so now I'm alone.
1:07:31 I see. . . How does that sound? Do you prefer working out alone or with your friend? No, actually if you're with a friend the motivation- Thank you.
1:07:40 . . , is more. That's, I believe. If it's like in, like two, three people or two people, the motivation is around, but that still depends on individual- You will see everyone is a different schedule, a different timeline.
1:07:52 So, sometime for the people who prefer to be alone. It's just not because of, you don't want it, because he is a different, uhh, workout form.
1:08:04 Hmmm, and. And he is a different schedule and he is a different time limits. So these are the things also.
1:08:11 take them to one side. Umm, so if, coming back to the hypothetical app, if it ha Great. I had features like, you could see how much a friend has, uhh, how many calories you've burned today, or how many steps or something like that.
1:08:29 Do you think seeing others' progress would help you be more motivated in your own workout? Go. Yeah, yeah. This is the main thing.
1:08:39 This I told you. Even it's maybe not 100% accurate. I'm going to go but it's give you the motivation and guideline and awareness that what you have done the whole day, what you have.
1:08:52 you like what you had in dinner and lunch and breakfast. So it give you like one general idea about your- A lot of, food also.
1:09:02 Yes, it's really helpful. I'll say. Because in fitness we need to- track these things. If you do track, then you will get the desired result.
1:09:13 You need to be in discipline. So, uhh, I think the application- will help to keep you in discipline. I see.
1:09:23 Uh, umm. Hi. Do you think virtual support, or maybe life gain, maybe features like that would help you? You want more?
1:09:33 You want to see that? Live training? Yeah, like, uhm, see if you're- out somewhere, or in an exercise, or maybe if you're planning your next workout, I'm going to start somewhere.
1:09:47 â€“ â€“ 2 3 Would you like having someone you can just message on the app, like, oh, maybe, like, a trainee, or anything like that?
1:09:56 â€“ â€“ Yes, it That way. I like kind of community, community to build a community, if you even have a part of community, yes?
1:10:03 You know, the fitness, if you- tic is- is an enjoyment kind of, uhm, hobby. It's much more better and much more easier.
1:10:12 See ya. Uh, rather than if you're making it much more stressful, no. Yes, there should be a, uh, discipline. There should be- The more it is, you make it enjoyable and it's much more better and you'll get much more desired results.
1:10:29 We'll see you week. You hmmm. Also. And this is the good thing. People, ehm, people will love to communicate like.
1:10:37 For me, I am a person who will love to communicate. And with this kind of application, uh, hypothetically we are talking about this kind of some sort.
1:10:45 Some part is there, believe me, people will love it. Mmm. I see. Mmm. . This kind of features you can end.
1:10:59 Okay. One, okay. Umm, so, I'm almost at the end of my question, this is magic. Oh, a anything that you would like to, uh, add or mention that you feel like we may not have asked or covered today, in our interview.
