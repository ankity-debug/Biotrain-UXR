00:00 researcher with Lemon Yellow. Thank you so much for joining us today. What we're trying to understand is, how people interact with fitness, health, and their well-being, how it fits into their daily life, what motivates them, what challenges them, and how, if they interact with technology, how do they
00:22 do it, how do they go about it? And before beginning, I would just like to say that there are no right or wrong answers here he only wants your honest feedback and your honest experiences okay right done done can you start by telling me a little about yourself like your name a gender occupation right
00:44 so I'm through I used to be in Mumbai now I'm in Dubai I'm actually a fitness professional I'm into fitness I'm a trainer and I'm working with this brand called as my PT I see and you said your currently based in Dubai right.
01:02 Right yes six months on Dubai right now. I see. Could you walk me through what a typical day looks like for you.
01:11 So currently I have to complete five in the morning because I have to attend to the 6 a.m. client because that's peaks lot so 6 to 10 AM I'm at the gym and then depending on my duty I can leave or still be at the gym so suppose if I have the morning shift I have to be at the gym till 3 p.m.
01:35 after that whatever time I have I go back home and then again for the evening peak hours which is like 5 p.m.
01:44 to all let's say 8 p.m. I have I can get back home. So, do you engage in any physical activity yourself?
02:03 Yes, so whatever time in between I take out for my workouts. I count my steps and even the calorie tracking whenever I have the mental capacity to do.
02:16 i see and do you engage in other forms of physical activity like maybe a class or a hike or anything outdoors other than the gym or it will usually be on the weekends or maybe whenever there's holidays where i go to play like make a cricket or batminton with my family or friends i see And about the gym
02:47 thing, have you buried a routine around it yet? Yes, so a lot of it is like data driven. For example, I'll track all of the major parameters like sleep and steps through whoop.
03:01 I also track my workouts from an app called as heavy. And I also track all the calories from healthy fire.
03:10 And few urine there excel sheets as well. I see. Could you tell me a little more about these Excel sheets?
03:20 It's basically like whenever I have to track my workouts or my client workouts things like you know deciding the weight selection.
03:30 So maybe last time the client had done certain reps and right now they are wanting to improve. so what to be it would be the best so there are like calculations for 100 maxes and through that I can help beside and then other things as well like you know if I have to ask my client to be on cardio so what
03:53 target heart rate should I prescribe in that and many more things like these I see so how long have you been going to the gym for or it could be like 5 to 7 years because I had an athletic background so it's from the start and I'm 24-25 right now I see Is there any other motivation other than your background
04:24 that made you want to be more active or fittered? Basically it came from the whole a passion of athletic this and then I had a thing that you know I was curious about learning and studying more about it.
04:40 So started to enroll into courses which were like renowned internationally and that's how it went. I see and what keeps motivating you now?
04:55 So it could be like a performance goal that I have to achieve a certain number of bench press in KGs for certain reps or it could be the look goal that I want to look a certain way.
05:09 For me, it would be the last priority that ok health and all like you know my cholesterol or BP but it's more towards the performance and looks.
05:25 So you mentioned that you do find time during your sessions to squeeze in a workout for yourself, correct? Yes. Could you describe a little more about the kind of workout that you do, the amount of time it takes and the intensity of it?
05:45 Right, so the workout training would be categorized into resistance training, slash hypertrophy which is to do with muscle mass increase and it is usually like machine based dumbbells or cables doing like 3 to 4 sets and in an entire workout maybe doing like 18 to 25 working sets where I am pushing majority
06:12 of the sets close to failure. And that should be it. The split could be probably like a push day which is chest shoulder tricep.
06:24 The second day could be a pull day which is last perhaps some biceps and thought they could be like a lower body day.
06:32 I see. And how many days of the week would you say that you're able to get in a workup for yourself?
06:41 So it depends on my health and the timing right now it's very lenient if only I have the mental capacity I'll get it but in a month you can say I'm getting like 8 workouts on the lower side and 12 to 15 on the higher side.
07:00 I see and have you ever tried working out at home before? Yes it's the Corona time and i ordered like you know wichs and all but yeah i never tried to do like body weight stuff and all of that, it was yeah i ordered like set of wichs and all and that was the last time i did that.
07:27 And did you follow any guidance like youtube tutorials or maybe apps or influencers or or anything like that? Not exactly YouTube and all but I do get a lot of resources in context to understanding the science behind and all from YouTube like main source would be YouTube there are like good channels 
07:51 like Andrew Uberman Lane Norton who are like PhDs and all so I do follow them I see And you mentioned that you weren't into working out with your body weight at home right you got more equipment or were there any other challenges that you face like maybe lack of motivation, guidance, lack of space, anything
08:16 like that. With working out at home, so usually when you work out with dumbbells and free weights they are what we called open chain movements and when you do body weight stuff they are close chain.
08:31 So usually when you do body weight and calisthenics for me in particular I don't enjoy the pump and the feel of it because I hardly have any muscle mine connection and whatever little weights I had at home.
08:45 or good enough to train and build muscles in context to smaller muscle groups like by 3 step shoulders. I used to not follow a routine but I used to get like a pump in so that I feel good about it and then get going with my day.
09:04 I see. And how comfortable would you say you are using your phone or any fitness app dhuring your workout or could be at the gym, could be at the home as well how comfortable would you say you are?
09:19 very comfortable because I understand the importance of it because there was a time when I used to not track my workouts and when I started to do that I had an exponential increase in the results like 15 to 20% and that was like a game changer for me I see and were you the ones amending the workouts 
09:43 after these trackings or was it someone else helping you out? No, it was me and it basically to work for me is because when I started track my workout I ensure that I am progressively overloading like it's not like I'm guess working or getting stepping down So the basic act of tracking helps me know 
10:07 my numbers and that's how I looked at the results. I see. And would you say you're working out alone or with your friends or maybe with another trainer or like a community?
10:24 No like for me I don't know whether I'm exceptional or exceptional case or not but I want my workouts to be alone.
10:33 It's like my me time. I don't like any distractions talking to people like I'm okay with people considering me arrogant that I'm not talking to all of the people but I really it when somebody is there talking and stuff like that.
10:49 But I really like to just put in my earphones and get my work done And that's my style of workout I see And do you track any health metrics Like you mentioned, you do track your steps correct Right Anything else that you also like tracking?
11:12 Yes, so recently I've gotten the hoop right So I'm tracking all the important stuff like sleep hrv step and trying to get to a conclusion with it and we are like basically I like to understand the science behind it and try to apply it how it maneuvering my life so those parameters and is wooper rang 
11:41 out of watch the woobband or the one or the wristband watch. It's like a non-screen one. I see. And does it come with an app attached to it?
11:57 Yes, so it's like subscription model where you have to pay yearly and you get the device for free and you have the application which shows the data.
12:09 I see. Is there anything particular that drew you towards work? Yeah, so apart from you know people buying it for reasons like we are not fully wearing it, for me it interested us because of the HRV which is heart rate variability for longest of the time people used to think that every consecutive heartbeat
12:34 is same in distance. but recently they discovered that it's not which means if the distance is lesser your body is in a sympathetic tone which is which means like it's promoting recovery and calmness when the distance increases it's like for sympathetic like it's like fighter flight so that data is really
12:57 shocking to understand I see and with these metrics that you How do you think this information helps you in your day-to-day life?
13:13 The simple thing like suppose I'm having a trend of my HRV being good and one day it just drops. I ask myself that what did I do different and if I come to know the conclusion that it was this, so I start doing or avoiding less of that so that it helps me, things like that.
13:32 i say so you closely like to monitor all the metrics yes i say and say you fail to follow through with the routine or maybe you skipped a workout how does that make you feel and how do you try to get back on track?
13:56 right so it does happen like right now I'm not tracking my calories or steps it's just that it's existing and I'm just having overview of the trend 40 or whenever I'm in the game and I'm tracking my calories I do feel like you know I beat myself up if I'm not following the thing I make it or suppose 
14:20 if I am supposed to have like 1,800 calories as a harsh calorie deficit, I will make it 2.2300. So that I am being sustainable.
14:33 So every time I promote sustainability it's easier for me and I don't beat myself up that you know I couldn't do it.
14:42 I see. I try and do that. And do you think visible progress or feedback from others? Which one helps you or motivates you to come back to the gym more?
15:00 For me it would be visible progress, but it's a mixture of both. I see. Do you think that if you skipped a workout or something like that, maybe reminders or notifications like that, do you find that helpful or would you say it would be frustrating?
15:23 I would be frustrating, whenever I don't track my calories and then the healthy fat shows like a pop of that okay, your back and all of that, so I don't know maybe 1% of negative side, it reminds me something like I am a failure kind of a thing, maybe like I don't get it, maybe I am neutral about it.
15:50 And what do you think is your biggest challenge in maintaining a routine? It would be the diet part, it's never the workout or steps, it's always the diet.
16:04 Be it following the calories, hitting the protein goal and eating clean. I see. And I know we spoke about you setting specific fitness goals like maybe an appearance or like a target weight or a PR.
16:25 Could you tell me what your current fitness goal is or what you have been working towards? Yeah, so my current fitness goal would be if I am at 25% body fat, I would at least want it to get down to 20 and just trying to retain whatever muscle it is and not posting a lot of weights but moderate weights
16:49 , like if suppose I can do like a certain kg on shoulder press, I would want to up it by 2.5 or 5 kgs.
16:57 I see And how do you track your progress with your goal? It's like that only like if I put on the heavy app that I took care of it for TKG, shoulder press for 10 reps every time I actually track it like I prepare for the PR maybe like two weeks of intense training 1 week of the load where I am relaxing
17:26 so that muscles recover and then I go for my PR and as soon as I enter the weight the app shows up with stars and rewards that you know it is the first time you hit this weight or the volume things like that.
17:42 I see. Do you have any physical limitations or health concerns that may be affecting your routine? may be bad sleep and frequently following ill and higher level cholesterol which I don't feel but it's a concern.
18:05 I see. So how would you feel about an app that would take into account all your data like the routine that you're currently following, the diet that you are currently following, any conditions that may be affecting your workout.
18:24 What if it took in to account all of these and then gave you tailored advice? Do you think that would be helpful?
18:33 Yes, like I would consider whatever the advice they are giving and I always used to find a huge between suits change to my calorie tracking up to workout tracking up to 10 other places and I always used to think that wish I had only one application which I could use all of this for I see.
18:56 So if we're talking about this one stop shop kind of an application, how comfortable would you be sharing your health data like your blood reports and other stuff to the app.
19:09 ..for a more accurate response For me it's not an issue I mean I don't think I would have any concerns with it Like I'll be open about it I see So you mentioned that you are following a diet right now correct Me?
19:30 Have you ever worked with a nutritionist or another trainer or a dietitian for it? No I haven't ever but it's just basically tracking my calories like I'll give myself a budget of 2300 calories I'll try to keep it majority clean and try to hit my protein goals that's the only parameters I follow it's
19:55 not like I have to eat like chicken broccoli rice every day It's like more flexible dieting. I see. So you're trying to eat better rather than following a structured plan correct?
20:10 Yeah, yeah. Because every time I think I have to constrain myself into eating the same stuff every time. It's very hard for me to do and I can't do it for more than 10 days.
20:22 So do you think that speaking of the one-stop shop app again? Do you think if it took into account your current diet and probably brought some more variety into it?
20:36 Do you think that would help you be more consistent? Yes, 100%. I find myself a lot of times referring to charity, where it could help me with a lot of lower-calorie versions of a lot of tasty things, but I don't think that the AI helps me with a lot palette up options, because its not out there.
21:02 But here ,if an algorithm which could consider all the parameters you know, there is a trend of low fiber intake or a certain mineral or Vitamin that could cause a certain thing.
21:16 I would really love that data. I see. So, would you say that you trust or you don't trust AI bhai bhai's recommendations i don't know maybe it's my prompting style or water search but as a professional in fitness i know certain answers to certain questions but Ranae asks the AI it gets majority of it
21:42 right but that niche answer that i'm looking for it doesn't get right so it gives you a generally correct answer but not the specific qualities Yes I see And would you say your diet affects your workout or your workout affects your diet?
22:05 Or would the diet affects my workout? I see, could you elaborate a bit on that? When ever I am on a deficit and after going for a long time, I feel depleted.
22:21 In the way I look and the motivation and attempting around it. So it does definitely work out like I see the numbers going down.
22:31 But I have convinced myself that this is what the process looks like. So that doesn't bother me enough. I say and do you use any supplements like multivioid vitamins or protein or anything like that?
22:47 Currently no botters or top tier supplements for me would be way protein 318 or omega 3 and yeah maybe that's it.
23:01 Is there a reason why you're not on them right now? Ya, it's just a commitment that is not giving me enough time to focus on all of these workouts and diets so I'm just on cruise mode right now, if it happens then well and good.
23:24 I see. And do you think speaking of the one-stop shop app again, do you think it would be helpful If it gave you more culturally relevant or regionally or where suggestions in your diet like for example.
23:43 If you like more of a certain cuisine, it suggests you more variety in that healthier alternatives for that. That is helpful.
23:54 Yes, that would be helpful. I mean, healthifying does that. it has like all the Indian foods and all it does not give suggestion but it has all the cuisine so it's never the case that if I take a photo of the food it's not able to judge what does it and how much is it but your suggestion would be great
24:17 . I see and you mentioned that you do use a couple of fitness and diet apps correct do you mind mentioning them yeah also healthy 5 me for calorie tracking and macro tracking and heavy at HEVY for workout tracking I see and who for Dangal, the normal parameters and combined with Apple help To just check
24:53 out the heart rate and steps and all of that I see Is there a reason you chose these apps for their particular functions?
25:05 Yes, so in the world my fitness pal is like the biggest app for calorie tracking But I don't use that as because they don't have the free AI version for capturing and I was really used to Like using healthy file like the user interfaces very friendly and I've done like my own transformation from 120 
25:31 kg to 83 kg using that app So tomorrow even if there's an application which is integrated all of these things that I want but if the user interfaces difficult to crack I would still stick to heldify I see and could you elaborate a bit more on what heldify does so good that it keeps drawing you back to
25:58 it? It is just that Caldee tracking and flexibility, like even if I want to have like a pizza or wadapao, I know that I will sacrifice later part of the day and I just lit in my meal and track that one, like suppose I am having one wadapao, I will just put it like 1.5 for the margin of error And we stress-free
26:23 about that it will have some fitness goals. I see. And I know you mentioned that you do a couple of ways of manually tracking your workouts.
26:38 Could you walk me through how the app that you've chosen to track your workouts helps you? Yes, so the heavy app is best app that I've found for my workouts.
26:51 it will show you record how many sets of what exercise I am doing and each set what we it is it and in that I can also put the RP rating which is how difficult that set was and I can also add things like drop set or failure set or warm-up set like it has a lot of flexibility like even after a year I 
27:15 can go back to the data at what date what particular workout I did what And compare it. And it has like advanced data like like what you say maximum recoverable volume MRV.
27:31 So suppose I want to grow my biceps or triceps. I will give it a good volume of like 20 working sets throughout the week.
27:39 So that data I haven't seen any other app for utilising data. I see. And do you know if the app integrates your variables like book into it?
27:55 It does, but I haven't used it for that reason, it just work out tracking. I see, I see. So would you say you prefer manual tracking or the somewhat automatic way of tracking that the app suffered?
28:13 I don't know how can I track automatically where the weights and sets are being recorded. I mean the heavy app has this variable option also where I can keep my side aside and track the data from my Apple watch.
28:30 So I just have to put it manually and stick on the set. I see and have you ever stopped using an or a fitness service mainly because of privacy concerns of your data or anything like that?
28:48 No, but I stopped using a lot of fitness because of the user interface just being very difficult to crack and just the other application being good enough.
29:01 so that I don't have to make the switch. I see. And based on the name biotrain, what comes to mind?
29:14 For me as a professional, it makes me feel like, it must be some advanced application which has track like biometrics and things which are like important or training purposes are just health in general.
29:35 If I were to ask you to describe the feeling that you feel when you hear the name biotrain and one word, what would that be?
29:43 Could be something motivating, relevant, trustworthy, anything like that or any other objective that you may think of? I don't know like a weird way to put it would be, it makes me feel like I'm able to imagine Dr.
29:59 Huberman or Elaine Norton who are like influencer slash scientist or it resonates with that. Like how Dr. Elaine Norton has this app called as carbon which sounds familiar with that.
30:14 I see. Do you think there is room for improvement in the name? Maybe, maybe or maybe not, I am not that creative, but for me it seems like okish.
30:32 So do you think it should be shorter or catchier or anything like that? No, I don't know because I am into fitness and I understand the details of it.
30:44 I don't know how impactful it will be for a layman. I see. And how would you say you feel about elements like having a streak that you maintain for your workout or having a leader board that you can share probably with your friends or maybe achievement badges saying you've done so on so do you think 
31:15 those are helpful or encouraging or just frustrating? I haven't done it myself, but I've seen few of my clients were like crazy about it.
31:26 But I also know that they can't be at their best game throughout. And when they are not doing that, they'll just, you know, not bother about it.
31:35 Or maybe it will just showcase that, you know, they're like a failure or something. But yeah, whenever there are that peak, it's like the best element to keep them engaged.
31:46 I see. And having worked with a lot of clients, do you think that they might be demotivated on a rest day or maybe a day that they're not feeling that well, if they saw this?
32:05 Kind of maybe. I see. And how would you feel about it like if you were on the app, If you were having a not a good enough day, do you think that would feel demotivating to you?
32:22 For me or usually whatever the parameters these guys track, the streak one, it's not of most importance to me. Even if it was like keeping me engaged, the days where I fail I'll just be like it's fine, it's not that important.
32:37 But for me and I'm not sure how much to be hard, they'll take it. For me parameters like you know the way time used to lift and if that's going down, that will really hurt me.
32:49 I see. Counts or wait that time lifting or calry tracking, things like that, that will really hurt me. Are there any features or trends in fitness or wellness apps that you tend to dislike or ignore?
33:11 as a fitness professional there are many of these like in our gym there's like my zone where they have like certain algorithm to calculate map now that parameter only shoots up when you're training very hard like 95% of your heart rate marks which is not recommendable for anybody who is above 40 and 
33:35 is having certain health issues But people train like that is because it's helping them get on the leaderboard and burning more calories.
33:45 But these are some parameters only professionals would understand that it's guiding them in a wrong manner. So as a coach it does make me feel like this is a wrong thing to channelize.
33:58 I see. And do you think for recovery tips or something like that, how would you prefer that they be delivered to you?
34:10 Like do you think maybe some prompts in the app or notifications or emails, what do you think would be the most useful?
34:22 Not sure like I don't think so come across anything so impressive that made me feel like it stands out when it comes to recovery.
34:34 And do you think recovery tips or guidance is something that people are actively looking out for? But in terms of fitness I usually feel like things just go bad in trend and all like people think about recovery first thing their trainer is suggesting or they haven't mind some massage or something but
34:58 recovery basically the best thing you can do is just being hydrated getting a steps in sleeping better or things like that.
35:09 Then comes your home role and all of that. So I don't know what name and person would mention to you but for me it's a different definition.
35:19 I see. Do you think having the correct guidance on these kind of things like you just mentioned? Recovery tips might look very different for someone who might not have the knowledge of fitness that you do.
35:33 Do you think that information is something that people would find helpful? 100% I feel like the entire fitness industry is on one side that if you want to sell something make it fancy but if you want to you want something to work make it simple so for anybody in their fitness goals or something I don't
35:54 think so there is anything important and better sleep butter movement, Caldery tracking protein fiber and just working out but usually it's just misguided with fancy things like do this do that which does not have more than 5% of impact.
36:15 I would really want if there is something or somebody who is promoting the right stuff and people see changes Isn't that life?
36:23 By doing simpler things. So do you think busting commonments like that would be something that people might want to be interested in?
36:35 I am not sure whether to be interested but that will create impact. I see. And have you ever paid for a fitness app or service before?
36:48 No but I have always considered paying for the healthy 5 pro origin because then they unlock like you know micronutrients also where I will understand whether how much micronutrients I get and all and the trend of it but I did not end up paying for it.
37:05 I see any reason that you chose not to pay for it. No just like diet just going up and down and moving to Dubai so did not pay for it.
37:16 But any time soon if I get dark eyes obviously pay for it, it's like worth the investment I see. And what kind of features like you mentioned the tracking of the micronutrients would be one that you would be willing to pay for.
37:33 What kind of other features do you think that you would be willing to pay for? tings like this one maybe you know if i get to know the trend that my diet is lacking in a certain micronutrient and that's causing me too positive frequently then it's like a game changer for me if i'm having a bout of bad
37:56 sleep throughout the week i'll have a direct correlation that tukia certain micronutrient is less or it could be some other factor it's like straight away connecting dots and it's worth the investment and it's hardly I don't know 3000 for the entire your Indian rupees.
38:16 I see. And what would be a reasonable price range that you would be willing to pay for like for the app that we mentioned one stop shop where it has the nutrition aspect, it has the work out aspect and it has the tracking for both, it also has personalized recommendations based on the changes in your
38:40 routine or any new advancements in your routine. Do you think what would be the reasonable price range that you would pay for something like that?
38:50 If it's an application which is combining heavy and healthy fire and just like the way I like it, I wouldn't mind paying 5000 Indian rupees for an entire year because in context to what already healthy fire is ready to offer like that.
39:09 I see and so you would prefer the annual plan more than a monthly kind of a plan. Yes, because I know that I'm consistent with it and it's useful for me.
39:26 It's worth the investment to just go for an entire year. I see and you mentioned that you like working out more on your own pace In a private way correct, like your own workout.
39:42 I see. Do you ever require assistance or guidance? Or maybe just someone to use like a sounding board. Like, oh, do you think this is correct?
39:52 Or has that never been something that you have come across? No, 100% like I have my own mentors and even from the internet.
40:02 Like, you know, people who have experience, not even maybe educated. But sometimes I do find that something they mentioned and I try it out and I'm just surprised that I was like not aware of it.
40:14 So I do have those movements where I feel like there's much more to learn. So I just try to keep myself as humble as possible so that I can understand and learn more from them.
40:26 I see and when it comes to workout I don't think I'm a person who would work out with somebody else and push and this all of that I don't prefer.
40:38 I see and the advice that we're talking about like you mentioned talking to mentors and other experienced people are these scenarios where you reach out for help or are these scenarios where they intervene or maybe they're just passing by they help you out.
40:56 something like that. Usually I reach out for them like you know just putting up open-ended questions and just trying to put up things where they can help and guide.
41:10 And through that I just come up with a solution which I never thought I wanted. But then I just figure it out and I'm surprised at all this while I was doing it wrong.
41:21 I see and do you think the presence of a live coach or maybe virtual support do you think stuff like that in the app would be helpful.
41:35 Yes in context to like entire lifestyle and holistic changes yes but in context to PT maybe I have my own biases but I think personal training should be in person.
41:49 I see, and do you think that having people around you, especially when you're working out, do you think the influence you in a positive way or in a negative way?
42:06 Makes of both like there are days where I feel intimidated by people existing and there are days where I'm just feeling happy and good and you know I would want people to exist around.
42:21 I see and from our trainers perspective, do you think a one stop shop app like that would be helpful in any way with you and your clients like in the way that you approach your clients?
42:36 Yes, like all this while I had issues with certain application not doing well like I would really want the best part of a certain application and mixing them all and I would really want that application where I can have my own client dashboard and maneuver it from there like we used to analyze but But
43:01 that has certain flaws, I use heavy but that has certain flaws, I use healthy fire that has certain flaws, but overcoming that flaws and coming together all the creeps, platforms and if any more features, I would really love that.
43:20 And just a couple of more questions before we wrap up do you think this app would be more helpful for you from a trainers point of view or from someone who's a gym go point of view.
43:35 like a person working out both both like I would really want that I can do a trainer I think where the client data is also there but the calvary tracking everything is also happening and my own stuff also can be done I see so do you think something like that where you have your own portal to go and see
44:00 your clients, data, the kind of tracking that they're doing. Do you think that would be something that would be helpful from a trainers part of you?
44:10 100% yes. I see. And do you think you would use the AI based recommendations for you or your client, or would that be something that you would just maybe refer and see how it is and then probably change your answer?
44:29 I mean I I would want AI to exist in every aspect of the thing like we had a gallery this that but then I would cherry pick accordingly like I would want suggestions.
44:40 I see I see. And are there any features or experiences that you think that we may not have covered or asked or mentioned today that you would still like to bring to our attention in context to this end of you.
44:59 On nothing I have readily available usually these things I go through and I just have it in that moment but next time I face something like that I will probably write it down and maybe send it to above.
45:12 yeah sure that works as well and I think that's all the questions from my side too thank you so much for your time this was really helpful and really insightful especially from your unique perspective and help us shape the next phase of biotrain so thank you so much thank you so much have a good day 
45:37 Bye-bye. Thank you all.
