0:00:00 Health, their well-being, how it fits into their daily life, what is their motivation, the challenges they face, and if they use any kind of technology as well.
0:00:12 Again, I just wanted to let you know that there are no right or wrong answers. Just feedback from your own perspective.
0:00:23 Sure, alright. By the way, I'm also a UX, uh, strategist. Oh. Be great to hear, uh, more about yourself, like your name, occupation, gender, age.
0:00:36 Sure. So, uh, myself, Praneet Ravi, and I'm from Kerala, by the way. I'm from Calicut, to be exact. And, uh, I'm actually a UX strategist.
0:00:48 And, uh, yeah, I've been, uhm, and regarding the fitness journey, yeah, I was a hardcore fitness freak, previously. But, uh, because of some other reasons.
0:00:56 You know, lifestyle changes and everything. So I kind of left everything and I'm facing certain issues just because of that.
0:01:04 Uh, I've been. And, uh, you know, uh, but yeah, regarding the fitness, uh, thing, so my perspective. Has changed a bit, uh, in terms of, uh, you know, going to gym and all those things.
0:01:18 So that was the primary objective first, uh, right. Now the fitness is more like a holistic, uh, I mean, if I have to take it as a holistic So it is more than a gym or anything.
0:01:28 So it is, uh, not just like a physical fitness that I'm into right now, uh, more than that, I'm mostly into the mental part of it.
0:01:37 So unless you are mentally fit, I don't think it, uh, really matters what you do for the physical, uh, well-being.
0:01:45 Uh, that is kind of a realization for me, and even after, you know, consulting with a lot of, uh, I mean, medical professionals and doctors and everyone, so that is kind of what I've come to.
0:01:54 And regarding, uh, the technology part, I guess, uh, I ha- I did use certain trackers. and stuff before. Then, uh, as time went by and I actually got, uh, you know, personal connection in terms of the medical field.
0:02:09 So, they suggested me not to use it, uh, interestingly. Yes, uh, so, they were saying that, uh, yeah, definitely. Nowadays, it's common to use smartwatches to track everything, right?
0:02:20 But, it has some adverse effect, uh, because on a constant basis, when you're, uh, you know, uh, in touch with this, whatever the laser grid and whatever things are behind.
0:02:30 So, it affects you in other ways. So, instead of that, they suggested, me to, uh, take, uh, you know, either you do some app, I mean, take the help of some apps, uh, like, habit tracking apps or whatever the fitness apps tracking apps, uh, and, uh, otherwise, yeah, a simple plain text, like, uh, you 
0:02:45 know, just noted on some journals. So there are, uh, so I just. Came to know, like, there are people who actually design this written up journals and everything.
0:02:54 So that was something more, uh. I would say human to me, and it actually gave me something to, I mean, it was a different experience altogether.
0:03:03 So, previously I didn't feel like. Connected to that thing, but when I write it down personally, I really felt it like, yeah, I'm doing so-and-so or my, you know, the.
0:03:13 Graph is technically changing, so that is something that I realized, and since then I've been tracking it in that way, and, uh, yeah, uh, so, yeah, that is what, how, how I'm doing things, yeah, other than that, yeah, yeah.
0:03:27 I see. Uhm. And where did you say you're based right now? Uh, I am based in Calicut, uh, Kerala. I see.
0:03:37 Can you walk me through what a typical day looks like for you? Yeah. So, uh, I get up, around, let's say, 5.36, and, uh, then, after all the morning calls, so I, you know, I do some yoga.
0:03:53 So, right now, it's 5 I started doing meditation, yoga, and stuff. So, that is what I do. And, then, sometimes if time permits, I do go for my morning walks, or maybe, you know, a bit of, I would say, running or something.
0:04:06 So, that is what I am doing. And, then, I. I do my breakfast, which is, more like a protein intake for me, I would say.
0:04:15 So, it is mostly the nuts. So, right now, I am following a certain diet pattern, which is suggested by someone.
0:04:23 So, there I have protein intake in the morning. And then, after, let's say, maybe after 10 or 11, I take some fruits or something, you know, uh, to help have, uh, that kind of a meal.
0:04:35 And then, by 12.31, I'll have, uh, I mean, by, max by 2, I'll have some carbs. Oh, which is, like, mostly rice.
0:04:43 And so, that is our staple food, I would say, in South India. So, we actually go for that. And, after that, I'll have some, I'll basically have some nap, just for, I won't say nap, it is more like a relaxing, You know, I'll just take some half an hour or, something like a break, and then I get to my,
0:05:00 I mean, in between all these things, there will be certain works I'll be doing, obviously. But, uh, yeah. So, I'll again get back to you.
0:05:06 I would say four or something, I'll have some kind of, I mean, tea and snack, I'll have some kind of a thing.
0:05:13 Then, By, uh, five, six, I'll just, uh, put a stop to my work and get back to, uh, you know, let's say some, Pooja Bhatt and stuff, whatever the thing is.
0:05:25 And, uh, if time permits, I'll definitely go and do some, kind of, a little bit of walking or running. If I have to go outside, so, I'll, I mean, I'll manage it accordingly.
0:05:34 And, then I go to the pooja and stuff. Then, after that, I'll have, some time with my friends or family or whatever, you know, like, uh, after that.
0:05:42 Then, uh, I have some, uh, right now I'm upgrading my clothes. So, I'll have some classes or any other meetings that I have that will be around, let's say, till 10pm I'll be busy with that.
0:05:54 Uh, 9.30, 10. And, uh, then we'll have, you know, uh, by the way, in between around 8.00, 8.30, 9 30, that is usually I do have my dinner at that time, but again, yeah.
0:06:07 So, by 10, 10.30, I'll be free. By 11.30, I'll be free. By 11.30, I'll go to sleep. So, that is my So, yeah, that's an interesting, but I used to have one to two hours of sleep previously.
0:06:25 And right now, I'm getting around, uh, seven hours of sleep. And that actually took time, so when I was coming to that particular, I was I had a serious, uh, you know, issue going on in between.
0:06:38 So, uh, I changed this within, let's say, some time. It took me around 6-7 months to get back to track.
0:06:46 And, uh, yeah, I have, like, since you're talking about fitness, I'm going into that detail. Like, uh, I was more like a, uh, I would say endomorphic kind of a, uh, you know, human body, I would say, for me.
0:07:01 And, uh, but, I did manage to, uh, I mean, increase my weight up to 8 kg. In a month, which is really, uh, like a tough thing to do, but that time I was completely devoted into fitness and my, uh, trainer.
0:07:14 Not easy. He's actually a Paralympics judge and, uhh, he is so, he used to train me that way. Uh, from that point of time, till this one.
0:07:23 Like, it was a really, you know, uhh, something very drastic. Like, the change has been very drastic. Uhh, now I'm trying to, I'm getting into that procedure, but it is really hard for me to, you know, suddenly change everything.
0:07:37 And keeping it and, uhh, your actually, change everything. And that is it. That is kind of a challenge I'm facing right now.
0:07:43 I'm not getting the, uhh, actual help. I need sometimes. Because, you know, my body situations change from time to time.
0:07:52 Sometimes it's going well. Then suddenly it changes and, Then I'm searching for a nutritionist or a dietician. And then they have to change my diet.
0:08:00 And suddenly after two months again, they have to change, you know, the protein and diet. But yeah, now it is kind of stupid.
0:08:06 That was so hard. Uh, because, you know, like, I did go through a lot of apps. I did- take a lot of, uh, subscriptions and even my genes and other things.
0:08:16 But that was really a challenge for me that, uh, there was not a one point solution. For me. Like, I had to run after a lot of people, like, for mental wellness, I had to run through somebody.
0:08:25 For physical wellness, I had to run through somebody else. Just dietitians, other, like, you know. Uh, and that is really a hard thing.
0:08:32 Uh, when I faced it, then I imperialized that nobody's acting. I'm actually getting that part. If you are into, I'm looking into that, that would be good.
0:08:41 I see. Yeah. and we'll do what we can kind of common physical activity that you do is probably running a market.
0:08:50 Oh. Oh. So I would say walking, uhh, I have been suggested as of now not to indulge in very, you know, hard and physical activity.
0:09:00 But I mean, was that handy? So, most people do some, uhh, Max to Max jogging would be something that I would be doing.
0:09:07 But otherwise it's, uhh, like walking. I see. And how long would you say that you have been following this route?
0:09:16 You And of you know, the morning, the morning. Sorry. So this started around, I would say, one and a . . . Once, so previously my, as I told you, my sleep cycles were not great.
0:09:29 So, uhh, it took time and now since one and a I've been on track during this. I see. And what would you say was your me?
0:09:40 And motivation to start. I wanted to get out of that bit. Like, I have been uhh. After I had to take a break from my, uhh, work.
0:09:52 Just because of my health condition. I used to faint. I used to be like, uhh. I was. I admitted to hospital multiple times, and uhh, that was really here, and, and I opened up for me, I would say.
0:10:03 And ultimately I was searching for- a lot of, uhh, you know, solutions, and then somehow when I started getting back into track a bit, so I thought, you know, it's time to, you know, hope.
0:10:12 Yeah, they seem. But you have one thing, again, I'm discussing on that, uh, major or realize. I was, unless your mental well being is not great, uh, even, you know, just working on the physical part of it doesn't help.
0:10:28 You Oh, yeah. I see. And you say is your density of the- I work out as compared to before and right now.
0:10:41 Right now it is close to minimal because previously I was- As I told you, I was a lot more into work out and, you know, if I say I have to take supplements, I have to do hard intensive.
0:10:52 Thank I think, uh, compared to now, like, now I don't take any weights or anything. anything else? I mean, I don't do any hard kind of a stuff.
0:11:03 Maybe I'll do it in the future, but I'm taking some time for it. And even the dietary- uh, things because, you know, you need some dietary requirements for certain kind of workouts.
0:11:14 So as of now, I'm not, uh, into that. That entire thing is completely opposite of what I was doing previously.
0:11:20 Yeah. I see. Yeah. Uh. Bye. And so, where do you usually, uhh, do your mouse? Sorry, uhh, your voice is big.
0:11:32 Sorry. Sorry. Uhh, am I audible? Yeah, yeah. Uhh, where do you usually conduct your morning or your e- evening walks?
0:11:41 Uhh, actually I have loan at my home, so mostly I'll be doing some and it'll be a bit. Thank you.
0:11:49 It's of gardening plus walking and all those kind of stuff. Otherwise, uhh, yeah, I'll just go through my friend's place or something, you know.
0:11:56 I'll just, Uhh, pull that on, isn't it? So, yeah. There's no fixed whenever it's done. So, oops. Oops. Uh, again you go.
0:12:08 Generally outdoors? Yeah, generally outdoors, generally outdoors. Nice. Bye. And you have to be doing in those, but uh, you see, I mean, my doctors and other, uh, I mean, my mentors also, yeah.
0:12:21 They suggested me to go out, uh, and if, I don't know if that is a relevant point to you, but I'll just admit, so, I'm- I was into remote, like, you know, I've been doing, uh, remote, you know, I'm in stand-up work, sentence.
0:12:37 Dennis. Around 8, 6 years now. Uh, like, uh, because of that, I started, uh, you know, get Good. Something into that introvert kind of a zone from an extrovert.
0:12:49 So, I don't know how much it is relatable to you, uh, as I told you. Obviously, I had a very hard intensity workout, and likewise, I was also into writing.
0:12:58 So, I was part of one of the, like, leading, uhh. Like, biking teams in India. So, we used to, I mean, you know, I used to be mostly outside.
0:13:08 But now since my uhh. I mean, mindset or whatever, you know, that I had a mental kind of a blog that I had.
0:13:15 So, I always, uhh, used to do work-up. So, whatever, whenever I get time, I'll just do things at home. But it was not helping me.
0:13:23 So, then now, uhh, things start- not changing once I started going out. Like, basically breathing pressure and doing something is totally different.
0:13:32 So, it is actually helpful in that. Yeah. So, that, that is again one motivation. Uhh, I see you asked previously, so that is again one motivation when I saw that change.
0:13:41 Like, do it. Something outside is completely different from doing something within a room. Uhh, so yeah, that was a motivation for me to do.
0:13:50 I see. And you would try to work out at home, right? Great. Uhh, yes, I did try to work out at home, umm.
0:14:02 And when you use or any, I was just kind of breaking in between, I don't know what. Umm, can you just, umm, try.
0:14:11 I'm trying to, I shift into the conference room, if possible. Umm, uh, I mean, You give us a second, uhh, just ensure that we are audible, better to you.
0:14:30 Sure. Thanks Yeah, oh.
0:14:54 Oh, my god. Uh, hello? Yeah. So, yeah, I was just asking if you have- I'll see you in the next of, uh, tutorials or guides.
0:15:06 Again, I think, uhm, and it's coming but in between now, you're- uhh. And, uh, the voice has got us dropping up.
0:15:14 Okay, just give me one second. Okay. You Okay, okay. Thank Uhh, hello.
0:16:34 And step away. Yeah. Smoot it on. Yeah. Oh, so have you followed any other audience or you, or anything like that.
0:16:45 When you were working out at home. Yeah, I did, uh, follow certain things, but I won't say it was, uh, like, interactive.
0:16:53 In the sense, like, live classes or something of that sort, because I was, like, physically already, I mean, there were mentors available.
0:17:00 So, in that level. But yeah, for, uhh, let's say the yoga part of thing, I did have some kind of guidance online.
0:17:08 line. But yeah, other than that, if you're referring to it, it should either work out things or not. Uh, that I prefer, uhh, I mean, doing physically with, in front of some.
0:17:17 I see. And did you find a helpful following? Yeah, definitely. Because, uhh, and that is. All right. We're going to do that.
0:17:25 We've got our something I would actually align to. Like, uhh, you know, because everybody has a different kind of a body structure, or let's say the how the body does.
0:17:33 It's not Sometimes, if something bad happens, like, or, or happens, there should be somebody to help you out. And that, uh, actually, is possible only when that physical help is available in front of you.
0:17:45 But, or just by looking in a video and you would do something and that person is not selected. Let's say, well, you know, let's say, and that is the case.
0:17:52 So, something happens, there is nobody to help me from that. So, yeah. So, in that term, it will be also, I see.
0:17:58 And I mentioned that going outside and getting fresh air is probably better. But did you face any other challenges like maybe I lose a lack of motivation sometimes?
0:18:13 times. So, umm, I would say, uhh, so there was a point. When I used to help people train, I mean, I did help some of my, uhh, like friends and all the world.
0:18:29 That time also, uhh, one point of motivation even for them or even for me was like somebody to, you know, uhh, let's say, gosh.
0:18:38 I do, or even motivate you, let's say, if I'm not feeling, uhh, I mean, uhh, that move to go to a gym or anything.
0:18:45 So, they will just get behind me. And tell me, yeah, actually, I mean, you know, like, it's, you know, like, you have to go.
0:18:50 So, that kind of a motivation, uhh, if somebody gets there, definitely then. And you will be able to try, I mean, achieve whatever you're trying to achieve.
0:18:58 Otherwise, you know, if it is just by yourself, yeah, there will be. There will certain breaks that are, you know, supposed to happen.
0:19:05 But, uhh, there is always, I mean, it is always good to have a companion, maybe it's a mentor or maybe it's a mentor.
0:19:10 But, you know, who is working out with you. I see. Uhh, so what do you say you, Prathav? You know, working out alone with your friends or maybe a trainer or community.
0:19:24 It can be either a train about, uhm- Bye. I would actually prefer having a friend. So, I mean, we can motivate each other and, you know, when one person is not feeling- In present, you know, I mean, I, I mean, I shouldn't be there because, you know, uh, random work out is about, all this money is pretty
0:19:49 good. it. So, uh, and I have seen a lot of people, uh, and I'm going to that exactly because of the whole list of written.
0:19:56 Thank you. Do you track any health metrics like maybe steps, heart rate, calories, anything? Amen. Uhh, so yeah, uhh, that's what I was saying.
0:20:08 So, previously I did, uhh, pack it on my smart version stuff. But then, uhh, you know, uhh, one, one is my doctor.
0:20:17 And the second, uhh, question was like, what kind of doctor, uhh, mentor or you. And he was the one who actually introduced me to yoga, stuff and stuff.
0:20:27 And he wasn't a psychologist, so one thing they took, uhh, read. He made me realize was, whenever he lacked too much, you know, we always get into that time that you're panning them.
0:20:37 Here we are, uhh, 2000. Any gas to those, not love, you know that. But, maybe for that day, 800 is enough.
0:20:43 Why you should do 1000, 800 is enough. But just to complete that. Like 200, you will actually have over exhausted.
0:20:49 And that is not good for a body. So, yeah, keeping a track is good, okay, uhh, keeping a track. In the sense that, okay, I'm working, uhh, for so and so time, you know, that is fine.
0:20:59 But, going into too much, like, micro management of things. That is going to harm you. That is what I have realized personally.
0:21:06 So, yeah, after that, it has been good at things in a way for me. I say, uh, speaking of micromanaging, do you think in a situation like this, like, say, See, you're skipping a day or something.
0:21:21 Like, the example we spoke about, like, a friend's motivator or something. Do you think,? Nudges or something from an app would be helpful or annoying?
0:21:31 Umm, I would say. . I would say this is completely a persons opinion, uhh, getting too much into digital stuff is.
0:21:42 you hasn't been helpful for me, uhh, I mean, I have experienced more digital stuff and, uhh, the other one, obviously, I-I said- I told you, I'm also a-I always be, you know, it is actually really nice to see a lot of things going on in the- that gamified kind of an experience we are getting on these
0:22:01 apps. But yeah, that part and came into the real world, uh, it was- I was actually showing up on everybody, or even, let's say, my mental state.
0:22:10 So, it was really helpful for me. And it is, you know, this, like, the first, And talking to you and saying, here, look, or then, that is completely different from what, you know, just, uh, sensual, uh, It always frustates you in sporty way, but somebody's coming and saying, he has to go walk out, otherwise
0:22:38 make you know he's gonna see. Let's say I have a cup of tea or a cup of tea. So, that is more like a, you know, that is the why we get.
0:22:46 So, yeah. I hope this is for the physical part. I see. Yeah. And, uhm, I know it briefly that. Bye.
0:22:57 If you don't mind me, uhh, if you don't mind telling me, uhh, what kind of physical limitation? station. Or, have conditions prevented you from achieving the workout that you wanted?
0:23:08 Umm. So, uhm, it was like a long term. I would say, uhm, uhm, one style left workout. I mean, doing the- The gym, you have to think, uh, that was again, uh, while left was, uh, because of, uhm, I mean, there was a, uh, chance that I might- I would have, uh, you know, jaundice, I mean, it was, uh, some
0:23:30 kind of a biltrugene, uh, I did. So, my trainers suggested, okay, you just take a- break for three months or something, you know, three or six months.
0:23:38 But after that, I did, uh, get that motivation, or I would say it didn't come to my mind here, I'll just- go back.
0:23:44 And once I went back, definitely there were a different set of people in the gym, so I was not feeling connected and I just stopped it.
0:23:50 Uh, so that was- how I stopped it. But then, uhh, as soon as I left it and completely avoided the physical routine, I put my mind completely too.
0:23:59 Whatever the things I was interested in, I was not in, uhh, you know, then my health kind of took a toll on me, uhh, the- some autoimmune disorder, I would say, I mean, those kind of things started happening, uhh, even the- but the interesting part was the- there was no medical, uhh, I mean, there was
0:24:19 no issues with my medical reports, but I was thinking in front of people, I was- like, uhh, they were like, a couple of very hard times, like, uhh, it was almost like, close to, uhh, I mean, you know, it was in a very uhh, you know, that's it.
0:24:32 Uh, so, after that, I started realizing each other, we have to work out and as soon as I tried working out, uh, then my body was not adapting to the new change.
0:24:43 Because it had tuned itself into, you know, that, uh, static kind of a zone with a, In the five, six years of that habit forming.
0:24:51 And suddenly when I started doing work out, it was actually opposing it. And, uh, Then it, it was like, uhh, now I'm just taking that baby steps, I would say.
0:25:00 Again, starting from the basic, like, uhh, you know. Normal, uh, working, running, or whatever, I guess. So, now I have, what I have been told and what I've realized is, I have to work on my- the cardio part, as of now, just focus on the cardio and that also from the basic year to start.
0:25:16 Maybe to take time, then only I'll, uh, uh, go into- there. So, would you say that the way you adapted your workout was- Uhh, did you make it on a lighter than density maybe?
0:25:32 Uhh, uhm. How? Uhh. Bye! I would say a lighter intensity because you completely stopped and your body actually overpowered like how you should react.
0:25:42 I mean, how it should react with a, you know, high intensity workout or maybe a uhh, uhh, gato workout. But, uhh, when I started pushing that boundary, it was opposing it.
0:25:52 And that was a bit better health, uhh, so, uhh, it seems like, you know, even the diet, I have been back.
0:26:00 You know, change from what I used to have, that actually, for an high intensity workout, that diet was completely specific for that.
0:26:07 But now, I see. When I take a diet, it is not going to, you know, I mean, my body is not going to sustain that part.
0:26:13 Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So. move. 7 I see. Umm, if the caution you use or any apps or devices that you use to modify.
0:26:24 Bye. Umm, do you like multiple apps? apps? Umm, I don't exactly remember the name of it, but if I could say in terms of experience, it really has to go, it had some kind of f***.
0:26:40 A gamified approach where it does make you tense or stressed out really are, you know. You you are in a dangerous zone or, you know, you have missed out.
0:26:51 Instead of it, it was more like a positive messaging. Like, you have issues. So, I mean. It only focus. So, that is my perspective also.
0:26:59 Okay. More than problems you should focus on solution rather than speaking a lot about problems. It is always good to speak about solutions.
0:27:06 So, it always motivated me in terms of solutions. Okay, you have achieved so and so yesterday you had taken on the uhh, you know, tooled us.
0:27:12 So, that was really helping me to uhh, you know, model. And again, I don't remember the name exactly of that half.
0:27:24 But it was more, it was a habit forming. So, that was something I wanted to work on. Uhh. And every person who is going to, uhh, you know, do some exercise, they have to think of it like a habit.
0:27:36 It should be an extension of their habit. It is not like you are doing a homework for somebody as it should be for yourself.
0:27:43 And that's why it is like that. First you have to build a mindset. So unless you are mental, uhh, you know, that thing is not geared.
0:27:50 You are not going to see what you are working out. You are working on a lot of weights. I mean, that won't be seen in your body.
0:27:59 Unless you are. Yeah. I see. And I'm going briefly mentioning that if there was someone who could. forward. be like a one-stop shop.
0:28:11 They're handling your nutrition, your workout, as well as your overall holistic wellbeing. We'll see So, if there was a hypothetical app like that, that would take into account all those factors, understand yours.
0:28:24 Okay. And then make suggestions based on that, do you think that could be something you would be interested in? we signed meeting.
0:28:32 Thank you. That would be of help, uh, but in certain conditions, I would say, I mean, there will be, I mean, important, but I mean, uh, let's say, it should have that personalized kind of an approach because whatever apps I have come across, it runs on, uh, you know, structured.
0:29:05 And then, you looking into, I mean, they should be well aware of your body. Because it is just like, you are, okay, he is 72, now he needs to go to 85.
0:29:18 So, this is the workout. This is the diet he should follow. Hello. That, that is the final thing that they give you.
0:29:24 And that doesn't work out. So, uhh, that is why I told you like, when I go to a gym personally.
0:29:29 I, I speak with them here. There's other issues, uhh, maybe last day I just happened with me. So, what should I do?
0:29:36 He will physically see me. And, uhh, sometimes uhh, the people who are more, so 1% just like my trainer I would say.
0:29:43 He is also into s- I mean, he knows certain other things as well, so if you, uhh, you know, if you come across certain things or whatever, he will do other things as well.
0:29:53 Like, you know, just to get rid of that thing, but, uhh, if I am doing it online, how can that come to me or he can basically just, refer you to some doctor, right?
0:30:04 That is all you can do. So, yeah, that is one block that I could see from our digital. I see.
0:30:13 So, um, speaking of this hypothetical app. I'm not I'm careful. I'll pick up... I've got it Let's do it. Let's leave it Would you be comfortable, uh, sharing medical data, like maybe a blood report or something?
0:30:25 If a, I promised you a more tailored plan? Umm, see though, just privacy concerns would be good. yeah yeah yeah .
0:30:33 . . So, if that is sorted, umm, and to a certain extent, I-I won't be like completely, I mean I'm aligned to that so I'll give everything and then if that data gets, uhh, into wrong hand, can be manipulated, right?
0:30:49 So So, yeah, maybe we can give them, uhh, or hight, maybe, yeah, blood type, blood type is also fine, weight is also fine, but more than that.
0:30:57 I'm going to specific off your medical conditions and stuff, and that might be thoughtful here. So, okay. Do you think that would be something you would be interested in if a short that your data is not being misused?
0:31:12 Uh. Bye. Yeah, I mean, see, I personally don't prefer them storing my data on a online portal. But. part. Yeah, I do want that my trainer should have all the data.
0:31:25 Right? I see. I see. See, they might take, uh, take an auto filter. We're done. Uhh, maybe not go for John or whatever it is, but I don't want them to store it in my, uh, online platform because nothing is safe here.
0:31:37 I'm not. If something gets stagnant, it is just going to run and so I will go actually prefer that part.
0:31:45 Thanks. You And I know you mentioned you're following a diet right now. Would you say it's structured all day long?
0:31:54 Umm, it is kind of, I want to say completely structured, uhh, because right now what I'm saying I have been suggested as, you know, listen to your body first, uhh.
0:32:06 So, if sometimes it says, you know, you know, I don't want to. I mean, I'm not going to omit it completely, but if let's say, I feel like, yeah, I mean, you know, I've been doing this for maybe, or, uhh, two things.
0:32:18 Three days continuously, and I'm the sped up a bit. I'll just avoid it for that day. I will actually look at a search group for that.
0:32:24 So, uhh, I have been told to- I don't think that you gotta do this for one day, do that for one day so that we won't get bored with your diet.
0:32:32 So, that's the way I've been going. But, yeah, ah, since you mentioned it, I've seen that, uhh. Some of the dieticians, right, they just give you a very structured planter.
0:32:41 So, when, uhh, morning you have to include this, uhh, thing about. You know, and diet is going to get into your head.
0:32:50 Like, you know, uhh, now you have been into shape. Like, you can't, uhh, think of it. That doesn't help, actually.
0:32:58 You have to do it on your freewheel unless you realize you give this word. However, I am taking his but for my body and it is my body is accepting it.
0:33:06 Then only it will reflect, uhh, you know, in terms of your health over to me. But, the then that I don't like people completely putting me into that space, you can't go beyond this stuff.
0:33:18 Just be. Because they want me to do it. Unless I am able to do it, I don't, you know, I won't.
0:33:24 I sing. Ah, ah. . And, ah, since we were speaking about, ah, like a dietitian or something, have you ever consulted?
0:33:33 I'll do it. One before, like a nutrition dietitian, or maybe even your trainer, or a diet. Yes, yes, yes. I have consulted.
0:33:41 I mean, I've consulted. Multiple people, I did, uhh, you know, follow their diet also, but I won't say it completely.
0:33:50 It completely helped me because they just give you the diet and again, that is the issue, one, one thing that I could see in all that platform.
0:33:57 Uhh. Till a point, it will be like, okay, they are looking into your stuff. I mean, you know, they are, you know, they are basically looking into your mouth.
0:34:06 But after a while, it feels like they are just giving you some general tips and advice. And, you know, you just, it is better to- go to Google and maybe certain, and now it is, it's like, charge-ivity.
0:34:18 Just check. Just use it and you'll get the results. So it was feeling, better that actually, activity was much better than the trainer outlet.
0:34:27 So, I was preferring that but, when a person, basically, So, that is much more relatable to me. You know, they have been seeing, my condition for maybe, let's say, some weeks, and then accordingly, it's like, okay, now, at this point, I think you should add this to your diet, or maybe you should avoid
0:34:46 this and, start with a new diet. Yeah. That is something that I personally have seen results with, other than, you know, just giving, some, the stuff things to do, and then you are not looking into that question.
0:35:00 Yeah. Yeah. Bye soon. Umm. I'm sorry. Would you say that currently your workout plan and your diet has been made by the same person?
0:35:10 We'll soon. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, is it, uh, your trainer? Uh, he's not actually a, I mean, the trainer.
0:35:18 very nice. In that sense, I mean, he's a, uh, he's more like an expert in yoga, this psychology and, you know, all this time in mental.
0:35:26 and to I mean, I mean, I'm having constant conversations with my trainer as well. Next is a you You also realize that now it is not the right time for me to go and you know start with the high intensity work or even the moderate ones are not suitable for me at this stage.
0:35:51 So, I am actually following the part what this person has said and just one more interesting thing, uhh, just well.
0:35:59 I mean, my trainer, like, he is into more like a traditional guy. I mean, I have seen two kinds of people.
0:36:06 I mean, in terms of, One of like, you know, they just, uhh, promote a lot of supplements. Just, just, I mean, do, uhh, I mean, you can do what.
0:36:15 However, the workout you want, you just promote your supplements and then, uhh, keep getting to maybe some sort of a shape.
0:36:21 And, uh, as soon as you leave that supplement, you'll get started. But, ah, when you start getting some issues or whatever the thing is.
0:36:27 So, that is one conduct training, but my trainer, what I've seen him, is, he's more into that traditional stuff here.
0:36:33 Like, ah, because you're gonna contact us. But, not that he would, you know. He doesn't let you do that strength training unless, uh, he's satisfied that you're.
0:36:47 You're okay with your cardio. I mean, you're as stamina is being built on water now. And he won't let everybody touch every machine.
0:36:55 I mean, he just, you know, he finds machines based on that particular physique or, you know, that particular body, even the diet and everything.
0:37:03 So, I would say I am in the right hands in both terms, like both the, uh, the exercise part or the physical part.
0:37:10 but it is a gym just beside us. There is this person, I mean, people go there a lot, but ultimately, they get some issues and they come- back to our gym.
0:37:20 Because they get, uh, physical- I mean, this- I mean, like, uh, dislocation and those kind of issues. Uh, and- that is something that I've seen across.
0:37:29 So, there are some friends of mine who are actually trainers in Doha. I mean, U.A. and stuff. So, this person actually trains people.
0:37:35 I to go there and become a trainer. That's mean. That is one thing. Uh, that actually doesn't let me go to any online person, you know.
0:37:43 Uh, it's kind of fair for me, because I've seen that, maybe because I've seen certain cases. I don't want to take a riskier, co-immigrant, and then I just, Okay.
0:37:52 I don't know that. I said, uhm, what kind of questions did, the nutritionist trainer or dietitian ask you before they were structuring a plan for you.
0:38:07 So, one thing was like, first they uhh, did a, I mean the basic check of uhh, what I was doing at that.
0:38:15 now. At the moment, I mean, what matter it was, and how much water intake I used to take, how much physical activity I did, and the.
0:38:23 But. My first question that you asked, like, what is my routine? So, entire thing. So, that was, uhh, some of the things.
0:38:30 Then they had, uhh, uhh, uhh, let's check on my medical background, like, if I have any kind of medical issues, any kind of uh, about my or, you know, even, I mean, my preference is, let's say, the wage non wage over the thing is, or, anyway, they're all like, supple- and that I've already taken and 
0:38:49 that with the ad asking everything. And then they started recommending me and, uhh, also based on, I think, I- I did see that one again.
0:38:57 They also, uhh, you know, tried. I mean, this is, I don't exactly remember which person did, uhh. Give me that thing.
0:39:05 So, they had, uhh, this idea, okay, in Kerala, you get this thing. In, uhh, oh, it might be better for you to go with this.
0:39:12 Or this basic, uhh, you know, like, you know, it is kind of a staple thing in here. But, uhh, certain people don't do that.
0:39:20 They just say, okay, you have to go forever. Yeah, it's available in Kerala. I mean, it is not me. It is a natural thing that you are getting out.
0:39:30 It's not the regional force. So, that is something that, uhh, actually help me in a way. So, yeah, that, if I want to point out that thing, so that was it.
0:39:42 But yeah, currently as of now, the- person who is looking into my case, he has been looking into my case since months, I would say.
0:39:50 So, once he has been looking after my case, so he- he knows I in and out, okay, this person has been through the steam.
0:39:55 So, accordingly he is giving you the solutions. Shh. I see. Ah, I miss him. Can you mention, like, even aware of suggestions?
0:40:04 Do you think something like that if the hypothetical app was equal to? Give you suggestions? Like, I knew you mentioned substitutes as well.
0:40:12 Like, if you're bored of a kind of food, maybe you suggest something like a substitute room, maybe if you like a certain cuisine.
0:40:19 Uhh, so, yes, actually, uhh, for me personally, even though- in my, uhh, reports, I'm not uhh, having any other G to that but, uhh, there are some situations where I have been uhh.
0:40:32 You know, uhh, that has been uhh, looked upon as the root cause which was gluten. So, now it is like, take only gluten free diet.
0:40:39 And I've seen- In India, there is not much focus on gluten free diets. Even though now the keto rising, like gluten and other keto and other keto systems.
0:40:48 But, uhh, if you go to uhh, the market, there is not much that they offer in terms of gluten free diet.
0:40:55 So, such a- things if available on certain places like, I think in Europe and stuff, they have gluten free option.
0:41:02 Alright, it is mandatory to write. Alright. Write it on your, uh, whatever that includes, but yeah, that is something I would say will be a, I mean, allergens.
0:41:12 and um, could you just mention if you track any diet related metrics like. I know you mentioned you check your protein intake, right?
0:41:23 Uhh, again, I would say, you know, I'm right now not going to- that micro management stuff of it, okay, this is my protein.
0:41:32 That I used to do. When I was in gym, I was in the UK, I've taken this much eggs. This much, yeah.
0:41:36 But now, as soon as I left that part, it is, I mean, I'm more peaceful in terms of having good.
0:41:43 Like, you know, uhh, I don't have to- look into the specifics, but yeah, if I think, okay, I have taken, uhh, you know, what is required for my body for now.
0:41:51 So, yeah, I'll make sure that I- I have, let's say, for example, if I want to have some dry fruits, I'll say, okay, I'll have dry fruits, but I won't look into this, okay, okay, how many.
0:42:00 me. Up. Uhh, nuts you are having, or how many just things. So, that I'm not going to look at it.
0:42:04 That's it. So, you, what do you say you just try to eat? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And again, I think in our, uhh, research field also.
0:42:17 You might also agree like, uhh, more than quantity we, uhh, prefer quality, right? So, uhh, in that way, it has been real.
0:42:25 We have put in this terms also. Like, when you have got effort, more than looking into the quantity of how much you are having it, it has been, you know, uhh, helpful.
0:42:35 I see. Would you say a workout affect your diet or your- That's what I would say, uh, hm. like, when you work out, when you're not working out enough in your capacity to- take the food is also not going to be- hmmm, get it.
0:43:01 You're going to come up. And, uh, if you're not, uh, having enough food, then you're not- I'm going to be able to work out in that way.
0:43:08 So, yeah, that is like, I think proportionate. I see. Ah. And you mentioned that you used to take, uh, supplements, right?
0:43:17 Uh, could you tell me what kind of supplements? And then, Like, multivitamins of protein or whatnot. Yeah, so I used to take vey, uhh, I mean.
0:43:27 So, that also, I was like, I would have started with vey concentrate, then after a while, I shifted to vey, I so, And so, that was something that I was doing, then I had, uhh, create in, uhh, and uhh.
0:43:45 And I, I think I also had BCC. I mean, uhh, so that actually was completely in accordance with my workout routine that time.
0:43:53 So, if I felt like, you know, I had to have that, uh, then I used to have it. Uh, and during that time, uh, I mean, there is a friend.
0:44:01 And of mine, who was actually a trainer, as of now, we used to, we started working out together only. And, uh, so we used to discuss, and we had some connections.
0:44:09 Outside, like, uh, who were doing, I mean, whatever, I would say, influences, in a way. Uh, you know, at that time.
0:44:17 Uhh, and this is around some nine years ago, I am saying. So, that time, uh, we used to connect with them, we used to get.
0:44:25 Some, uh, you know, suggestions or addresses, I would say. Then, uh, also discussed with our, uh, trainers. Uh, so we used to work on.
0:44:33 Different different gyms. So, he used to discuss with his trainer, I used to discuss with mine. And we also tried, uh, shifting to some natural, I mean, we have been trying to go for that natural body building part.
0:44:46 So, even though we used to take supplements, we've ensured that it is, minimal. Like, what if the brand suggests you to take two scoops of protein, or three scoops of protein.
0:44:56 He'll only take me to the half scoops. One scoops. Rest of the protein take was completely through our diet. And, uh, that is, uh, and interestingly.
0:45:05 Thank you. And, during that time, only I had grown around 8 kg. So, no. And, it was a no effect, uh, thing.
0:45:12 Like, that bulking was complete. So, that was something that we had tried and we had success. But we- just to do some high intensity work for that assumption.
0:45:25 I see. And, umm, I know you mentioned that when- you feel like you don't want to follow the diet, you probably try to find a substitute for something, right?
0:45:35 So, do you think? Like I mentioned, you also refer to chat GPT sometimes. Would you be able to trust AI based recommendations for your diet?
0:45:46 No, not exactly. So, I uhh, personally don't refer to one source for anything. Even I said it before the uhh.
0:45:54 You know, there's diet or any other medical things. So, we had a better idea. I did use chat GPT. I might do other types of research as well.
0:46:02 Then. I might just talk to some people who are into this field and even pick up them or let's say the all of this, uh, uh, day align with.
0:46:10 That's what I am thinking, then only I might actually prefer that. I should. We'll go, uh, blindly on a AI stuff.
0:46:16 Mm-hmm. and you And, uhm, let's dive a little deeper into the experience that you are with the- Other fitness apps?
0:46:28 Yeah. Uhh, could you again list the names that you made a member that you have tried or something? Something like that.
0:46:36 There was one app, uhh, which, like, you know, which, uhh, uhh, I mean, it was more like, not like a fitness, I would say.
0:46:42 Actually, it was more of a dive, uhh, dive recommendation. I'm okay. I'll be fine. Uh, uhh. I think it is healthy.
0:46:52 I mean, they, uhh, they are like, you know, they, uhh, they actually have a lot of dieticians and you can, uhh, get them and so on.
0:46:58 One was that, I think it was, heh, if I'm not wrong, there is some, I was different. So, that was it.
0:47:04 Then, I had some foreign apps. Uhh, I don't exactly remember the name. So, I have, actually, you know, what I used to do.
0:47:13 I used to try one app for maybe- let's say one week or one month or whatever. Then if I'm not getting this, I mean, you know, I'm not getting that satisfaction.
0:47:21 I'll just keep it, right? It tried two, three apps, then I shifted to the physical part of it. So, one will be, yeah, one Indian app, if I have to say what's happening.
0:47:30 Umm, then uhh, there was, uhh, that was some kind of a U. you look. I don't exactly remember, but if I get it, I will share it with level.
0:47:44 Okay. Yeah. That's good. Appreciate it. . If anything, you remember from the top of your head, like, what were the main reasons that- Yeah, because, uhh, again, what I said, it was more like a mechanical thing.
0:48:02 I mean, I was- It's not feeling very personal. Uh, I'm important. I mean, it doesn't mean, like, you know, you get your height weight and everything.
0:48:10 That's it. But it is more like a human touch. Like, a person should know you personally. Like, what is going on with this kind of, a subject and, you know, accordingly, suggest two things.
0:48:21 But that was more like what you said. AI kind of, I think, you know, that experience is not very human.
0:48:27 Oh, yeah. I see. And yeah, I think, right now, just also suggested, just get away from digital stuff. You have been- Sorry.
0:48:35 Yeah. I see. And I know you mentioned at the beginning about, uh, variables. Go ahead and chat. And stuff that he used to have a watch, but he said it wasn't great.
0:48:46 Uh, do you mean telling me what kind of watch you? First, I used to have, uhh, this. What was that brand?
0:48:56 Yeah, noise. You know, there is a brand called noise, so they had a, The watches, I mean, I don't completely, you know, believe in what the tracking is, but it was just giving a, giving me all this.
0:49:07 You stick view, okay, you're doing some steps and, you know, like, it is going well. They had this app. Uh, there was some app of those, noise, switch, switch, or something, and, uh, it used to track the sleeve and all this metric, but, uh, thing is, then I shifted to Samson.
0:49:22 Uh, Oh. It also did pretty much same. Uh, I mean, maybe the tracking is maybe much more accurate or, I mean, what they're playing.
0:49:31 But, uhh, I mean, ultimately the experience, if I have to say, yeah, the app experience, the only thing if I have to look at.
0:49:39 Get into the aesthetics of the app, or maybe the tracking, which they say, this is more accurate. That is it.
0:49:44 But, uhh, if as a person, though. Thing is the same, like, both are having that kind of a, uhh, that always wears on.
0:49:52 And there should be always a very ting of hand, whenever you're sleeping, you have to track. Uh, everything is going that way.
0:49:59 So I've, uhh, as soon as I actually left that, then I realized that, yeah, at that time I was most- like, you know, when I have to go to see if I have to tie this or- Probably without the- And I was always conscious, I was over- Yeah, I've not done this much as I have to go out, go out and go out and
0:50:15 I'll just leave my work and work, then I'll have the pension career, I've left my work. So, you know, you are in that constant tension, so as a brand for them, they are making me stick to their product, for them it is good.
0:50:27 Oh. But as a person for myself, it was more doing more harm. So, I saw it. I kind of loved it and, uh, but yeah, in terms of that, uhm.
0:50:35 It helped part. My doctors also said, you know, that whatever the tracking mechanism they're using, it is actually not good for any law.
0:50:43 So, they, uhh, I mean, for the people, they know personally, so they don't suggest using all-in-law variables. It would have been a no, it actually, they were saying it causes cancer and stuff.
0:50:56 So, that reason, I shifted from that. I completely left the, uhh, I would say, uhh, smartwatch category now. I see.
0:51:06 Yeah. Um. Bye. Is it just smartwatches that you would not wear, or have you seen those new, uhh, tracking rings and stuff?
0:51:15 around. Yeah, I have seen that. I have seen that, but again, the concept is the same, whatever you're tracking is, you know.
0:51:20 I know if I if you have that, and even if they even that companies themselves, they say, okay, we are not 100% accurate.
0:51:31 Like, you can't- you can't really rely on this and say, yeah, I am fit and fine. Yeah, but that you have to take a ECG machine or whatever it means to get in the hospital.
0:51:39 So- Just for that, why you are getting into that state here, you know, you are not there. Yeah, I am safe.
0:51:47 This is my question. I mean, you know, because you are getting over conscious. issues. I see. Umm, coming back to this hypothetical app that we advance.
0:52:03 and begin about based on the name of bio-train. That's B-I-O-T-I-A-N. Okay. Okay. What is the first thing that comes to your mind?
0:52:17 Bio-train. See, it's more like a trainer and, And that was, I mean, that is something that's coming to my mind.
0:52:26 And I don't know if, Uhh, that part has been covered or not, but when you say bio, it is that entire, uhh, like, it covers your entire, human perspective.
0:52:37 Like, it is not just your, you know, uhh, like, I would say, uhh, just the way training or stuff to, It is more into, like, everything.
0:52:46 Uhh, maybe it's your health metrics, maybe the other, uhh, you know, let's see, the diet requirement. So, what about the discovering entire, uhh, I mean the entire thing?
0:52:56 Oh, yeah, that's what I'm thinking. I don't know. I see. And listening to the name Barrio Crane, if that was the name of Anna, what do you think you would expect from the applet?
0:53:07 Good. What kind of features or anything that you have in mind? See, primarily it is like a train. Alrighty. What I am, uhh, understanding it is more like a training app, which maybe connects me to certain things.
0:53:26 But, uhh, but I am more than that biocarc, I am in my focus. So great. Well, thank you. This is going towards the train.
0:53:34 The trainer part is coming into, uhh, picture. But, again, since bio is good, I might expect that trainer knows. In and out of, uhh, everything about the human body, like, it is not just the way it works.
0:53:46 Mm-hmm. I see. Does the name feel motivating? Maybe it's relevant, or maybe trustworthy? Next one. What side are you leaning on?
0:53:58 Uh, see, umm, I won't say completely, very much. much motivating us. So, I mean, I'm able to relate it with the train part of it.
0:54:11 But, I won't say it is actually- I mean, if I'm very honest, please don't mind. Bye. Yeah, I am perfect.
0:54:22 Not very, I'm not saying that uniqueness or, I mean, that cash, you know, coming out of it. Yeah, that is it.
0:54:31 So, what do you say there is room for improvement? Yes. Yeah. I mean, that, I think it can be a bit more future proof.
0:54:40 Yeah, they have. They say. Umm. Bye Have you ever sought out four leekable tips or anything like that after the workout or have you ever sought out three?
0:54:52 me. Yeah, recovery tips or anything like that after the workout. Yeah, recovery tips. Um, I mean, when I used to pray.
0:55:01 . So we, uh, had certain, uh, time like when we used to, you know, we didn't know about meditation or anything, but, uh, a train.
0:55:09 And I used to say, like, you know, you have to have, uh, this post-work or whatever, the, uh, uh, supplement these particular things.
0:55:15 So, so, you have to have it. Within 15 minutes, and then we used to relax, maybe for 15 minutes or something, you'll be just in that, uh, meditative state, not- meditation, but, you know, just be relaxed and stuff.
0:55:27 So, that kind of a thing was there, but other than that, uh, nothing much, like I won't say it- But, yeah, and there was something like, we used to practice, if I'm working out for the legs today.
0:55:40 So, yeah. I'm not going to work out for the next 72 hours on the leg. So, take the recovery or time that you're giving for your, that particular muscle.
0:55:49 Uhh, so that kind of things we did, uhh, you know, take and yeah. Also, we used to take some Ayurvedic medicines with it.
0:55:56 I mean. During that routine, for example, Chaganta, I don't remember exactly the other names. So, we used to, what we used to try.
0:56:05 It was, you know, bringing that point, I mean, pitch of Ayurveda along with this thing. So, because Ayurveda is quite famous and good luck, and- Okay.
0:56:13 Oh, we used to, like, uh, mix and nog out of both the things, and interestingly, it will work out. Yeah.
0:56:20 I see. . . . Umm, I know you mentioned that you did, like, maybe think Asian elements, like, speaks or something. What's your- What's your on event streaks, achievement badges, leader bones, do you think they come out healthy competition or do you think they might- I'm not completely into that.
0:56:40 So, again, when I said about stress. Let's go. When you look at yourself as a better version, it's totally fine.
0:56:52 But when you- You look it into that sense here. Okay, the other person has done so much and I'm not done so much.
0:56:58 So I'm not up to that mark. It actually demotivates. You know, like, uhh, some person, because of certain reason they may not be doing it that way.
0:57:06 But the other person is telling you, okay, this is enough. But the other person who has a different body structure, he might be doing extreme.
0:57:14 So, but you are comparing with that person, which doesn't make sense. So, that actually does the opposite of what that app intends to do.
0:57:22 I see. Umm, do you think that if instead of- So, comparing your progress to others, if it showed you something like, oh, you've been doing much better than last.
0:57:33 Bye. Like, you're, you're beating yourself from last week. Do you think that would be something more? That, that would be that.
0:57:40 I mean, comparing- Bye! Which are past might be better. Like, you know, you were at the first step and now you're at the 10th step.
0:57:48 That would be much better. And maybe it's a, uh, you know, it's, it has some kind of a, I'm just going a bit technical audio.
0:57:56 So let's say it has some- kind of an algorithm which works on a specific, uhh, this set of data that, okay, this kind of a person with this particular.
0:58:05 You know, that has to have this situation to call himself or herself as healthy. And you are just reaching that mark.
0:58:13 Or let's say you have closed that, not accordingly, it will give you the messaging or whatever the communication is. Then it's fine, but otherwise comparing it with a different, individual, it doesn't.
0:58:25 I see. Umm, we spoke about, the fitness apps, right? Have you ever paid for a fitness app or service? I have paid, but only, let's say, you know, as I, We'll see you in like, maybe, for one, we got max to max one, one, one, one, and sometimes it is on trial, like, you know, uhm, we got to- I was testing
0:58:47 out, is in every option, and I couldn't find a perfect solution. I see. Um, if- You can recall, do you remember what were the features or any particular thing that made you feel like, oh, maybe I should pay for this?
0:59:02 Umm. So, one, one was I remember like, uhh, you know. you that I think nowadays in the watch itself it is that uhh, water.
0:59:14 So, I used to drink very less water basically. So, it had kind of. For gamified, uhh, things. You know, you're filling your body so it will have some better graphics which it shows.
0:59:26 The like, you know, you're filling your body up to this extent. And it actually gave some kind of influence that area to the more than a watch.
0:59:32 Like, watch is only a small interface. But if I'm looking into the app and think, okay, only half of my body is filled with water, I need to feel the rest.
0:59:41 Thank you. So, that was actually a motivational thing. I mean, I'm not saying I will pay for it, but yeah, I'm looking into that kind of an interface.
0:59:49 So, yeah, it really depends. Okay, what do you mean? Then there was like, so, uhh, again, uhh, you know, it basically tracks your habit.
0:59:58 build. More than a, I mean, I was using some kind of habit record. It actually was acting my habit, so if I, uhh, so it will ask you a couple of, questions and it will ask you like, what do you want to achieve?
1:00:09 What is the better version that you see for yourself? And accordingly it will set certain parameters. And then it will give you, okay, this day you have to do this distance.
1:00:19 And as soon as you do one step, you just click on it. You have done that. So it will just, you know, check mark on that.
1:00:24 And that is, that was actually, at least with that note, I believe it was more personalized. Because it, it is going to map your entire routine or whatever the, you know, body type you have.
1:00:37 And accordingly, it will be. It will you the solution. Maybe it is different for you. It will be different for me, but yeah, it actually relates to me.
1:00:43 So I'll feel guilty I've done so and so I'll check them out. So according it will give me a result.
1:00:49 And there was some kind of points I remember like, you know, it was to, uhm, I mean, it had certain- of an animation which was like, it was like, you have so and so.
1:00:59 And if I didn't do it, it will get- Yes, we are locked this much point. So, it will give you certain amounts from the, uh, during the registration, it's- I've been, like, say, maybe 10,000 points or whatever.
1:01:13 And if you did, uh, some task, it will add up. If you don't do it, so it'll- I see. And if you remember, could you tell me what kind of a price?
1:01:26 That's it. So, uhh, price range, umm. So, see, like, uhh, some of it. . . It was like, you know, foreign apps, like the apps that they have.
1:01:38 definitely, they will be in terms of the others and it is obviously going to be filed again. get. And, uh, then they had certain advanced plans, uh, uh, that we went to, I think, fifty-six-tee-dollars, everyone was like, oh.
1:02:01 I don't know, they were some advanced features. But I only took their, I took their, uh, trial back. Uh, and they had this trial back for two dollars, I remember, if I'm not wrong.
1:02:12 Two dollars will point up, uh, this one. One weeks, uhh, axis, and then, uhh, you can maybe continue it, otherwise you can just cancel it.
1:02:20 Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. So, I think for the Indian apps, I remember 6.9, uhh, 6.9 or 7.9, that range it goes.
1:02:33 Yeah, for the month. Yeah, for the month. Uh, which one would you like to That is a basic one. and that is.
1:02:39 Yeah, again, if you're going for the higher point. Yeah, I saw. Also, would you prefer a one-time payment monthly? I mean, not just for health helps.
1:02:55 . to have. I should know, you know, uhh, rest here every month I have to do something better, uhh, but unless I am satisfied with that, you okay, this is.
1:03:11 Otherwise, I won't, you know. I should. I won't. Thank you. What kind of, uh, good social features would be useful enough that NASA have like that?
1:03:25 Mm hmm. Uh, nothing that actually compares me to somebody else. Umm, but if I'm busy, okay, I'm, uhh, you know.
1:03:35 Umm, I'm sharing it on insta- uhh. You remember, like, previously, in Facebook, I remember, uhh, yeah, in Facebook, uhh, those are features.
1:03:43 Like, you know, you're posting from, so it's a phone. Or, you know, that kind of a thing. Okay, maybe, in that way, if I'm getting something, I mean, there are certain- I if you might have seen, like, when we take photos from iPhone or whatever, there will be a iPhone in front of them.
1:03:56 So, in that way, if you're doing some kind of a posting on our- Instagram feed or maybe Snapchat or it gives you a, I mean, it has nothing to do with personally, but, you know, it's just, uhh, maybe say that you are doing a big special.
1:04:11 You are doing something on that app. For the app, uhh, as I was- for their marketing. But, for me, yeah, I am doing something special and somebody will notice me here.
1:04:20 Yeah, this person is doing a working on himself. Yeah. I see. Umm, I know you briefly spoke about this, but do you think having a live school- That would be a human element, I mean human touch should be there, uhh.
1:04:43 Otherwise, I don't prefer, like, completely, you know, a machine oriented learning. But would you say you're comfortable with using your phone during a workout?
1:04:55 Well. Uhh, not exactly, uhh. So, uhh, you know, that, I don't know, it is like a personal opinion. opinion. Uhh, sometimes when we, uhh, look into that phone.
1:05:06 So, my entire phone, because it is a small screen, and you are maybe working out in a, bigger space. So, this small screen is actually pulling you towards that.
1:05:16 Your entire focus goes towards that phone, not your muscles or your body, well. So, instead of that, okay, if I'm getting a donut smart, if I'm working at home, or maybe even a gym, I have to get bigger.
1:05:28 Thank you. So, they, I mean, they look equal to you in terms of size. Life size, kind of. Yeah. Yeah.
1:05:42 That actually relates to, uhm. I see. And I'm just a couple more questions and then we can write it. Uh, I will be off.
1:05:52 Move. Feel the people around you, motivate you, like, do you think their influence is a positive one or a negative one?
1:06:00 Not always. Umm, sometimes, yeah, people do say here, go to a gym, you know, you have, you are looking big, which I, uhh.
1:06:09 I tend to get, you know, you should move back to that. But sometimes, when you start with a gym, people will say, yeah, you know, should have gym, right?
1:06:17 Yeah, you know, like, yeah, it'll just haunt you in a good way. But, you know, sometimes, actually, it doesn't feel good to hear that.
1:06:25 But, I think, uhh, you know, that awareness, uhh, ehm. If they, it totally depends on the people around you.
1:06:36 If they are also health conscious, they are not going to look it in a, you know, traffic. Instead, they will motivate you.
1:06:41 But, you know, that is where I was coming to. So, when you are posting certain images on your platform, let's see what I'm Instagraming.
1:06:49 And they see a brand, uhh, logo or whatever the thing is associated with that. They will be getting interested upon that app.
1:06:57 They will explore it. And, yeah. I mean, that is a proven thing that if a person looks into something, at least for ten times, they are, I mean, they tend to, who get interested on that, but they expose that thing.
1:07:08 Well, technically when it, I mean, a lot of people, you know, explore that thing, it becomes a trend. And they've, you know, they will also come into that zone.
1:07:16 So. I see. Umm, so I think- Thank I'm coming almost at the end of my questions. If you feel like there was any other experience or any other- Bye-bye.
1:07:29 Talking that we didn't cover or we didn't mention, uh, you can feel free to reach out to us or let us know.
1:07:36 Or if you have any thoughts right now. Uhh, actually, I don't know, like, if you guys are working on that or not.
1:07:42 But, one thing I'll, uh, and that is the gap that I could see. In this industry, that we are not taking enough seriousness in terms of the mental health.
1:07:52 You In the body. But they don't understand, like, I think nowadays itself, uh, you might have seen a lot of cases, like, uh, you know.
1:08:09 Even if the person going to a gym is getting heart attack and he's waiting in the gym. Uhh, they are not looking into the party, they are having some stress a day-to-day issue in the office of whatever, like, in the life of a lot of people might be going on.
1:08:23 So, there is a wrong perspective and- Go ahead. I personally also had this, uhh, like, you know, whenever I feel stressed out, I used to go to gym and I do some intense workout that I used to take on the gym.
1:08:33 Like, and we feel like, okay, I have, I have completely an acoustics, but that is the wrong way, uhh, which I have learned in- I mean, I would say that was a hard time for me.
1:08:45 So that is something that, uhh, I have not seen any app. Have a good day. Doing that. I mean, there are, there are a lot of apps which only focus on meditation.
1:08:54 People think that they are going to be karka. That is, umm. But, I'm not saying a meditation app or anything, but there should be something that gives you a holistic solution.
1:09:05 Not, I mean, when you say, help, it is not just correct. It is also mental, like, physical placement. So, if somebody is, uhh, not just motivating you to- you know, pull up a lot of weights.
1:09:16 They are also motivating you to stay happy or dismount with the practices. That is something that could make a change.
1:09:22 Other than that, already there are a lot of apps doing fitness things. Mmm. I should have posted, I mean, you know, as you just asked, Because me, like, I've tried a lot of apps.
1:09:32 From one app, I've jumped to another, from other, I've jumped to the third one, but I never stick to one app.
1:09:38 And because I never felt a difference between this. If I feel a difference, there should be something different from what other people are doing.
1:09:46 So, uh, yeah, that is one thing I have to say, like, keep somebody giving me that option as well on, uh, platform.
1:09:54 Yep. So you would say that and I have for it to be different. It would probably have to include all the three aspects as in.
1:10:02 The work out with the nutrition and the mental wellness, correct? Yes, yes, yes. So when a person looks into it, they shouldn't feel care area to like, you know.
1:10:10 It is again an app that promotes gym or a gym not about gym. So gym doesn't essentially mean like you're healthy.
1:10:20 You have to be healthy, you have to look on all the three sides, so yeah. I see. Umm, I think- come on the end of my question.
1:10:28 So, thank you so much for your time, Prini. And this was really helpful. I'm very insightful. Full. Oh, and we hope that this will help us shape the next phase of umm, you came right away.
1:10:40 So, thank you so much. Have a great rest of. . Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye.
