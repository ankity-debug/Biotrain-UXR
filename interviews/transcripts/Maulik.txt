0:03:13 Thank you very much for me. I know you mentioned you playing with your cats. Yeah, so that is the most physical activity I eat.
0:03:19 Yeah, I do. Yeah, I work a lot and honestly, like, I live in, I live on 9th. I see, I see.
0:03:37 . . . And how long have you been following this particular routine for? Since corona. Mm-hmm. I see. And have you ever been going to the gym before regularly or anything like that?
0:03:53 So, as I said, like, when I used to live in Singapore, like, I used to run 5km a day. So it was my, uhm, happy to, like.
0:04:01 It was routine for me, and I used to work out for 3 hours, uhm, 3 to 3 and a half hours.
0:04:08 But, uhm- Once I came back, it all just stopped, you know. I see. Umm, would you see- Like, what was the frequency of the time you were working out in a week?
0:04:22 Every day. I used to take- use today. Like, uh, once I'm lost, but uh, didn't it depend on my- We'll minute.
0:04:35 Oh, I am physically, uhm, in a way like, other leg ski I could do, so that didn't- I'm 90% a sada taka kibwe meg utli ma gutli rum gai ma rum rum gai ma rum gai.
0:04:46 See you soon, fam. Aye soon. Aye. Umm, if you don't mind me asking, what made you want to work out mode?
0:04:56 So, it was the good- But, I'm sure there, uhm, like, uhm, uhm, when I was there, I noticed, like, people, they are, uhm, ehm, ehm, very, uhm, very more, like, they are very much lean towards, uhm, you know, maintaining the, uh, physley.
0:05:22 one. You know, working out at every corner, even the Singaporean government encouraged this a lot. So. And then go. So on every corner you would find gyms in the garden.
0:05:35 So you'll see people like those that man in my. I society was I think it was completely blind and I saw him swim for the whole year.
0:05:45 Mhm. Mhm. It was completely blind but still he used to swim every day. Thank you. So, I said, yeah, when I saw that I just hit my like, uhh, vehicles hit me with the, uhh, the engine.
0:06:02 And after that I started working out and all. I see. So. So you would go for it and and also go to the gym daily or was that.
0:06:15 Yes, yes. So my schedule then was. I got studying in Singapore then. So my schedule was, uh, as soon as I finished my college language was twice a week.
0:06:25 I'm going to make a uhh, I used to come and otherwise if not college at around 7, 7, 30, I used to go for a run.
0:06:33 one. I used to come back. I used to have my, me legs and everything. Like, uh, I changed my diet completely as well.
0:06:41 Back then. Mm hmm. So, no sugar, nothing. Like, you know, just lean protein and all. Uh, which is an all.
0:06:49 So, post that. Uh, around the midnight, like, at 12 a.m., I used to go to the gym, kukita, kuine, rata, tah, tah.
0:06:58 Like, I- I used to have the whole place to myself. I used to work out, uhm, until 2, 33, 3, 30, like, based on how- How did they get there and feel the ones I used to go back home?
0:07:10 I said, I'm healthy, whatever. Lord. I tried working out at home before. Yeah, like, I've not tried. I just bought things like that.
0:07:22 Bye. I bought weights and all but, uhm, honest to God, I like, I've never touched it. Like, lee, I always go, cupboard, mirror.
0:07:30 Like, DNA, it's there ever since. I see. So, how long would you, like, do you have any- haven't read one of those sessions at home?
0:07:42 No, no, no. I just don't feel- I just don't get motivated enough to- You And like, uh, mommy, d******, uh, biceps, momma, blah, blah, you just got, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, To la set me with that.
0:07:55 I can understand. So, would you say the main challenge was, uh, lack of motivation? motivation or was there other factors like maybe timing or space?
0:08:06 Anything like that? No, no, it is, it has always been lack of motivation, like it. Timing space, I don't care.
0:08:13 Uhh, like there are gyms available 24-7, so like, uhh, the space kind timing I said, so I- I can go at midnight, like I used to do that anyways.
0:08:22 Mm-hmm. Okay, so it was always motivation. I see. And how comfortable would you say you are using your phone during your workout?
0:08:34 Like I used- I used use my phone all the time, like I, uh, see, getting a trainer in Singapore was very expensive, okay?
0:08:41 So I never got a trainer for myself. So there are these, uh, YouTube videos, like I used to follow, uhm, like, you know, the way they taught how they, uhh, exercises to be done any particular exercise.
0:08:54 Uhh, so I used to watch them and I, I just learn from them and they, And I started doing it, like post that, uh, for entertainment purposes I, I used to use my phone, umm, but uhh, I did not have any Uhh, I did not have the need to.
0:09:15 you you know, follow these videos. I see. Yeah. So when you say you were able to. You develop a thing for yourself through watching these videos.
0:09:27 Yes, yes. I see. Thank you. Umm, have you ever used any other apps or just YouTube tutorials whilst you're voting?
0:09:38 No. I just use the YouTube tutorials like, uhh, uhh, at that time I did not even know that, uhh, like, you know, a lot of- I did not know a lot of apps that existed, uhh, and a few I knew were not good enough.
0:09:54 Love. As in, yeah. YouTube and I get plenty options compared to the app. Like, if, uh, see at the end of the day.
0:10:03 Be it in the app or, uh, be it on YouTube, uh, we would be seeing the tutorials, right, uh, videos of people doing something.
0:10:11 So, uh, plenty of you get on YouTube rather than a particular app. I see. See you later. Umm, would you say you prefer exercising alone, maybe better friends, or without- Okay.
0:10:27 Yeah, not community, like, I don't like, uhm, too many people around. ground. Now. The the my exercising, but, uh, alone or with a couple of friends or with the trainer zone.
0:10:42 Like a couple of stages as well. And in the gym, that is fine, but if the gym is, like, tightly packed, then I have to wait in queue, uhm, to use a particular.
0:10:51 A machine or something, so that I would not prefer. I see. So, I can see why you, like, going to the gym at night, so, like, exactly years.
0:11:05 Yeah. I see. Have you ever tracked any of your health metrics like your slimy, heart rate, maybe your steps? . Oh, ladies.
0:11:17 Yes, so when doing cardio, I used to track my heart rate, umm, uhh, uhh, uhh, other- otherwise I did not, uhh, like, uhh, Mira Yerukinta, to be honest, like, uhh, see, I am a smoker.
0:11:31 Don't cut it off. Since childhood, unfortunately, okay, to manage this a pascal-o-meter-dodum that I used to smoke wild stuff. And, honestly, like, it would not, uh, create any entrance for me, so I did not feel the.
0:11:47 Oh. I need to track anything at that time, at least. And, uh, yeah, so just. Yes. During the cardio, like, if I'm running on a treadmill or somethings, umm, I'll track my heart beating all but.
0:12:04 Umm, nothing, nothing other than that. You see, suggest the heartbeat. Yeah. Ehm, I said. Thank you. Thank you. And, how would you use that information in your life sign?
0:12:16 I said you probably monitor it to see if it's fluctuating. Right? Yeah, so if I see, I don't remember exactly what was the threshold I kept like, umm, but as a, and maybe, uh, from running, I switch back to walking, uhm, uhm, like, you know, tower walking.
0:12:42 Like, just go for- I put that time, like, key, until it settles back, and then I used to start again.
0:12:49 Mm hmm, I see. Yeah. Mm hmm. What would be your main motivation back then? Like, I'm using the people around you and the culture was influencing you.
0:13:00 What's the- Anything else? No, no, just that part. Mm hmm. I see. So, were there ever times when you- I would not able to complete a routine as in you may be able to skip a workout or modify a workout.
0:13:15 Were there any times like that? Yeah, uhm, not something that would just come on top of my head, but of course like a, .
0:13:24 That's a very common thing if you're working out and if you're either studying or, like, you know, working somewhere, there are, So, yeah, of course that was there.
0:13:46 I see. So what would help you get- back to your routine and those times. Nothing, just say, for example, as to get together.
0:13:56 So I went, I met with my friends, like, which heard or something and, uhm, next day nay, so I'll go to this.
0:14:04 You like, there was nothing, uhm, yeah. So just your schedule would affect a transfer. Exactly, exactly. Sadly. Umm, would you say that your visible progress, as it may be?
0:14:20 It be you from like a couple months ago, looking at the progress that you've made compared to yourself. Was that more?
0:14:28 Very helpful, or maybe feedback or compliments from others. Which one was more meaningful to you? Seem both. Uhh, actually, uhh, uhh, feedback and compliments is something that, uhh, you know, you might get, you might not.
0:14:45 But, uhh, visual, uhh, growth, I had seen, okay, the visual impact. back. that was there. That was much more helpful.
0:14:56 Umm, as in, uhh, it was much more uhh, uhh, uhh, it was complete. . Anything to my motivation even further. No.
0:15:05 I see. So it would just fuel your motivation. information. No. Exactly. Yes. I see. Uh, do you think that in these times where you were not able to, You know, follow your routine.
0:15:19 Mm-hmm. Do you think najas or reminders from an app like, maybe, Oh, it's your workout time. Do you want to do this?
0:15:27 Is this? Do you think those would be annoying, frustrating, or hopeful? Yeah, so see, uhh, uhh, for me, how it was.
0:15:38 Initially, I had set, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uh, uhh,fouuuh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, function, uhh, uhh, uhh, So, I'm a reminder on my AFI REIT SADI SAD BAGI, so go for the RANA, sir.
0:15:54 Okay, but, uhh, what happens is, when you are willing to, willing to go for a run, that really helps. But, uhh, if you are not willing to go for a run, like, let's say, It used to get a bit annoying, it used to, uhh, give that guilt, uhh, like, you know, it used to build that guilt.
0:16:22 Yeah, like, why did they use to it? Yeah, yeah. So sometimes, It was a mix of both, like, sometimes annoying, sometimes there's a guilty feel that way.
0:16:35 Mm-hmm. Actually. Thank for your attention. Umm, have you suddenly witnessed goings? Could be right now. Could be before. Yeah, before.
0:16:45 . What I had like, uhh, I used to be 115 and I had a goal for 70 to 75. Uhh. Alright.
0:16:53 Alright, we'll. We'll see. And I achieved that. But, uh, right now, uhh, right now, nothing. Mhm. So, what do you say?
0:17:01 Your main world right now would be just to get some sort of physical activity, or is that even- No, no, I'm com- I see, I see.
0:17:19 Uhh, before when you would actively, you know, we spoke about physical progress. us. . Could you tell me how you were able to do that?
0:17:28 The accurate progress? Was it just, was it even, or would you use anything else also? Oh. Oh. So, uhh, even right now, I don't know if there any tools to track the progress.
0:17:40 But, uhh, there were a few indicators. That I used to, uhh, follow up on. Uh, first, obviously, being the, uhh, visible chain.
0:17:49 18. In my physique and in my body, uhh, in my body tone. Okay, so muscles being built and all. So, uhh.
0:17:58 That was there, then the second was uhh, the level of endurance I built. Mmm. Yeah, okay, okay, bye. Okay, so eventually.
0:18:12 eventually. Uhh, running 5 kilometers non-stop with, uhh, like, you know, taking 5, 10 seconds, come break for flexing. you Uhh, or stretching, rather, okay.
0:18:24 So that was definitely an indicator for me, feel the same. game. I suppose in, like, you know, lifting weights, like, you start with 5 kg or something, and gradually you increase that.
0:18:37 So, those. was . with the indicators, uhh, but nothing else that I know of when I use it. I see. Mhm.
0:18:46 All right. And was there anything frustrating about the whole process? Like, maybe the whole routine was getting a bit too.
0:18:54 How much? Anything like that? No, no, I see. I never kept a rigid routine for myself. And, uh, throughout the time I walked out.
0:19:02 So, I, uh, I did, uh, supersets only. Like, uh, nida esa taki bai. And, and. and still, like, I'm a bit stubborn.
0:19:12 Uh, so what happens with me is ke bai aga kardna eta kardna ea. Okay, and then there is no. I think that will stop me.
0:19:21 Okay, so as I said, I never had to come to lanes or anything. Uh, uhh, okay, Uh, uhh, uhh. Never experienced anything that frustrated me.
0:19:29 Umm, okay. Okay. We are going to take a look at this video and how it works. Umm, umm. Do you have any physical- is it going?
0:19:45 Uh, back then I did not. You want to now I do. Uh, if you don't mind coming. Yeah, I have slipped this.
0:19:57 Mm-hmm. Yeah, so my L4 and L5, uh, normally the gap between them, uh, should be somewhere around 12F. . . And, uh, right now it is, uh, a little less than two Mm, so it is reduced by a bit more than 10 Mm.
0:20:14 You So that prevents me from lifting weights and, uh, uhm, doing exercise, exercise of that kind. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So how would you say that you have to adapt your routine around it?
0:20:30 I so. Why? Right. Did you not work out any ways? I'm not working out any ways. Like, you've got to have a team that will help you.
0:20:38 Oh, I see. Thank you. And, yeah, then it gave me a reason not to go pushing me even, like, you know?
0:20:45 Yeah. I can- Oh, I'm- was there anyone you consulted during this time regarding your schedule, regarding your work? Or Daniel and Jody?
0:20:56 Concerted as in, no. Maybe like old Irish and or a tree, you know, or anything like that? I'll see you in No, no.
0:21:04 Like, as I said, like, uh, see, uh, I used to work out when I was in Singapore and I got slipped this, uh, a couple of years back, so in.
0:21:10 23. So, I, I was not working out anyways at that time, so, like, I never consulted. something I didn't need dietitian or anyone.
0:21:20 Mmm, I see. Umm, are you following any sort of, of, uh, nutrition plan or a diet plan right now. Be it as structured or as loosely structured.
0:21:33 No, no, oh, bad note. . Uhh, the meds are too wrong. Haha. I see. And have you saw a load of one?
0:21:43 Uhh, yeah, yeah. When I was working out when I was in Singapore, I used to wallow a strict diet. So, not, not strict diet as.
0:21:51 In case someone gave me this, uh, force, uh, of this plan to follow. But, uh, my thing was, give me a n eel and I bust.
0:22:01 Ehm. I see. Yeah. So just trying to eat better. Yeah, I did. Better. Yes, yes, yes. Eat better and more protein based.
0:22:10 Also, uhm, did you- I can tell someone, did you come up with this, did you, you know, he was going- anything like that.
0:22:19 All right, we'll you in the next one. I'll be honest, I don't remember exactly, but definitely I might have used Google.
0:22:27 Uh, of course, I did not consult anyone. Like, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, I would never pay someone to tell me what to eat and what not to eat.
0:22:35 But, uhh, I did uhh, I, I, I, Must have moved. That's for sure. Like, uhh, not to find out what to eat and what not.
0:22:47 But rather to find out if we, uhh, uhh, not to eat, uhh, not to eat. Like the portion size. Thank you.
0:22:55 Exactly, exactly. Like if I'm eating, uhh, beans or tofu or something, or something that is rich in protein toast. I think, yeah.
0:23:13 And would you track anything related to diet before, like maybe- Enjoy! Yeah, yeah, yeah, I used this uhh, under Amata Kurzko app.
0:23:25 I don't remember exactly what it was. Of course. Hmmm. But uh, Usmay, Sathakki, you're put in your uhh, like, you know, whatever you eat.
0:23:35 Okay, you just put it in and it would give you the nutritional uhh, uhh, value of it like this. Make it in a car, get it in a protein.
0:23:43 But, uhh, it did not fly for long because uhh, like we also eat homemade food, right? And us being Indians, uhh, you know, war-tracked, nagibais, nadotam, insamat shithil, dalai, hai, hai, hai.
0:24:00 So, you don't get the exact count anyways. Okay, so, a girl, man, it puts, S.I.G. 7, 11, silly. I, uh, I bought it from a supermarket or store or somethings.
0:24:14 Get a wo-me. Gets it out of curiosity. Like, yeah, but just out of curiosity. Like, ah. I say I was like, OK, Yeah, yeah, I was forced to check the nutrition.
0:24:23 And then decide if I want to buy it or not. I think.
0:24:37 Oh, and what do you say about them? and why are diet choices affecting your workout or was your workout affecting your diet?
0:24:46 No, no, nothing if. You Messy expected anything actually, like I said, not give me a word. No, no, speed I can't do it.
0:24:54 Alright, thank you. I don't need to live. Okay, so, uhh, but uhh, yes, uhh, this, uhh, there was a thing, okay, bye.
0:25:03 you Yeah, uhh, uhh. And if I'm feeling guilty, like, depending on that particular time, okay, I might- I might work out more, or I might run more, like, passively, side-to-pad shake-a-millometer-doll-long-da.
0:25:26 Just to have that, uhh, peace of mind, because, you know, uhh, nay. Compensation hasn't given me mental compensation, giving me an alley to chillin' away.
0:25:36 Or bill yes, I may agree. Yeah. I see. Um, would you take any supplements? Clemens. Like, multivitamins or protein, creatine, anything like that?
0:25:48 I took protein, I took creatine, uh, creatine. 18. I took one more thing, like, I don't remember what the name of it is.
0:26:00 You know. I mean, no assets could stood, uhm, if I'm not wrong. Can you work out? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, yeah.
0:26:08 Oh, yeah. I see. Yeah, none of it was recommended by any professional, like, mr. Do's. I see. And what would you say, like, I know you mentioned you like food.
0:26:31 all depends on your energy. It's didn't you If you didn't, So to run S magical. So were there any other challenges preventing you from a diet, like maybe you don't cook for us or something like that?
0:26:41 Nini, I used to cook, uhh, uhh, I used to eat out, uhh, there were no challenges. engine. The only challenge was to give a man who, uhh, got to put a panic, uhh, uhh, uhh, I'm worried.
0:27:04 And I know you mentioned, like, it's difficult to talk homemade food, get up? Yeah, yeah. So. So, So, do you think, maybe, if there was a hypothetical app that would take into account your routine, your, schedule your current level of activity, your current diet, and probably give you suggestions, like
0:27:28 , maybe, How do you, in a structured plan, just to try to get better at your habits? Do you think that would be something that you would be interested in?
0:27:38 See, I'll definitely give it a shot, like, uh, S-N-E-A-T-M-O-S-P-O-T-B-U-S-N-E-C-R-U-N-G-R-R-U-N No. But then it depends on a lot of things, uhm, as in the, you know, how much, uh, like, is it free or- is it, uh, to be paid for?
0:27:55 Paid. Yeah. I see. I'm doing- Thank you. Yeah, yeah, go on. Sorry. Not just that and, like, on top of that, like, you know, is it really helpful, like, son of a girl?
0:28:08 rule. Uhh, let's say, you saw those sopan purupi lithi, because that does not make any difference, like, it does not put any dent.
0:28:16 But, uhh. Umm, you know, being that and spending time on it, even if, uhh, like, is it used for, not.
0:28:26 Okay, Kabika, we have seen a lot of apps, like, uhh, they ask you, like, 5-10 questions and they'll just give you a random, uhh, like, you know, common, centrated diet, a very, very, very low.
0:28:38 So, we are not following. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know if that's enough. So, would you say that the reason, one of the reasons being, is that they don't feel tailored to you.
0:28:49 No. Exactly, exactly. Of course. No. Because every, everyone has a different, different physical, right? So, uhm. The body might not be for the person next to me.
0:29:01 Okay, so if something that is recommended. recommended. to me, it should only be tailored considering what my, uh, what, what my.
0:29:13 I attribute side in terms of, uhm, you know, everything like, uh, diet, routine, schedule, everything. Do you think if the app was also able to suggest, like, I know we mentioned.
0:29:29 As Indians, we like things with dial rise. They might be, you know, difficult to track. If they- Or, umm, a way to track the raw ingredients as well.
0:29:42 Do you think that would be helpful to you? Okay. Let's do Yeah, of course, of course. Like, that is the whole point of it, leggings.
0:29:49 Yeah. That is a must have. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Uh, like, if someone is seriously concerned about, um, what they are eating, okay, and what, uh.
0:30:01 you know, they are having in terms of, uh, like, you know, getting up at a year, getting up at a year equals p.m.

0:31:44 Okay. So it. Give the opportunity to exactly track the abka in tikka wahaha. Begin. again. Ah, be just other message.
0:31:56 Dalka Lunch is only home. So, in I for it uhm, uhh, d-what, oh, I'll I'll just So, do you have a day?
0:32:08 Or day is Like, you know what you are having? Mhm. So, if I were to review, don't . different options of clocking.
0:32:20 One would be the way that you mentioned that there is a recipe given, and then there's. Proper measurements and proper steps given so that I can just follow the recipe and make the exact, you know, portion size.
0:32:34 And the calorie pound stuff. And the other way would be that taking the same example of a dial. Bye bye.
0:32:42 Say I add that okay, I put three tablespoons of that and my, uhh, recipe. And I use- maybe three tablespoons of oil, stuff like that.
0:32:53 If I could note that term, dealing that would be something more interesting or the fact- that following the recipe would give you a more accurate form.
0:33:02 The, uh, noting down would be precise. face. Okay, but at the UX perspective, it would be a lot of work as well.
0:33:13 Correct. you Okay, and uh, some things, some names I don't know. Okay, for example, I don't know Kali-dalfo-ki again. Good.
0:33:23 Let's say, okay, because see if you are talking at an app level, okay, it has to consider everyone and everything.
0:33:30 Okay, even the smallest of the edge case. but I don't know, I should I should have I think I should have taken I don't know how much content is there so rather.
0:33:46 better then that if I have specific instructions on, uh, what to use and how much to use and how to use.
0:33:53 Okay. Okay. Mm. Make it more streamlined and more, uh, universally applicable. Okay. No. Ok. Iwill see you time. Okay. So that is very.
0:34:10 Ready? Pretty much customized and becomes, umm, very complicated in terms of development, in terms of usage as well. Thank you.
0:34:18 Mm-hmm. I see. And, do you think something like, for example? Call me, please. No. Go on. No, I'm not seeing anything.
0:34:30 Oh. Uhh uhh, no, no. No problem. Oh. So you say there was, maybe if you wanted to eat tofu, but you were a bit bored of the usual way you eat it.
0:34:43 Umm, say you just wanted some substitutions or even something like how you were incorporated in your existing diet. Bye! Yeah, maybe you could mix it in a gravy, something like that.
0:34:54 Do you think those kind of suggestions that are aware of the stuff that you're like, probably suggest you a healthier alternative?
0:35:02 Do the stuff you like doing? That would be something helpful. Fully. Yeah, of course, like having variations in tools. Have you cooked stuff?
0:35:11 Okay, keeping the ingredients same. Like, uh, the mesi- ingredients, keeping them same and, uh, providing variations or healthier options on what you can cook.
0:35:23 We'll see you Okay, is, uh, something that I would like to see in an app, uhm, but, uh, then also, like, you know, it bu- I prefer the, ehm, paces.
0:35:40 Okay, so let's say for taking me particularly. Okay, I eat things more spicy. Okay, so if your app gives me or your AI suggest me something that is really blunt in tears.
0:35:54 Okay. Okay. Uhh, I will be cautious of using it the second time, the third time. But if that thing comes on- 3 7 .
0:36:05 I would eventually stop, uhh, like, you know, consulting the- What if it took into account those factors as well, like your preferences, the companies.
0:36:25 Yes, yes, yes. Then it is okay. One, I see. And would you be comfortable trusting AI based recommendations? Nations. None, not entirely.
0:36:38 But, uh, see, that is very much biased towards my profession. Oh. . Rather than, uhh, someone who is non-technical, uhh, in terms of, like, you know, what they do.
0:36:51 Okay, because I being, uhh, into the field of IT, uhh, knowing AI in depth. Oh. people. Okay, I know that there are plenty of examples where in false recommendations have been made.
0:37:07 Okay, well, at the end of the day, I just came through the data. It has been trained on. Okay. And.
0:37:15 and it tailors the recommendations based on that. So, not necessarily, uhm, yeah, you know, yeah. Okay, it has all the, uhm, necessary.
0:37:31 Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so you might get, uh, false, uhm, this as well. Recommendation that. As well. Okay. Just say, let's see the whole purpose of AI is, like, you know, uh, having a conversation naturally.
0:37:47 Like, you and I are, uh, are happening, right? So, agar means a bollooki by, in English, of course, but, uhm, translate.
0:38:00 Okay, it should be very spicy. See It should have less oil. I give those generic information, okay? But let's say it uses some ingredient that s that I might not be aware of that I'm allergic to.
0:38:16 Okay, so I do some men that could be okay, I've never, uh, had she received in my life. Okay, so I don't know what it contains and maybe that is allergic to me, but on this- Okay, so it creates, uh, immediate threat.
0:38:35 Go ahead. Okay. Okay, to my health and that will potentially, uhm, like, that can potentially lead to legal issues and a lot of things, you know, I'll- that's why my first recommendations were taken by Womu this step by s- step, but I, I've been refined self-flour all those, those are much.
0:38:56 Okay, so that information is already provided. Uh, before you start any crepo or anything, you know? Hmmm. I think. Like, I don't know if- It does make sense, but in my head it does so.
0:39:11 Yeah, definitely it does make sense. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. . I actually had a follow-up also, like, for example, say if you had blood report.
0:39:24 Do you have blood reports done regularly? Uhh, no, but when I'm only when I'm- I'm suggested by my doctor. Doctor?
0:39:35 Yeah, yeah, yeah. So like full body check up in all many controls generally. Yeah. I see. So would you be comfortable sharing medical data or?
0:39:47 you maybe a blood test report or something like this with the hypothetical app. If it promised you to give you more.
0:39:56 accurate recommendations. Like maybe if you have a vitamin deficiency or something, it'll help you, you know, say this foods like that.
0:40:04 Yeah, but, uh, again, depending on what it is asking me to share. Okay, there's a Arab blood group. Oh, yeah.
0:40:12 I don't care if sharing can be a positive way, uh, a negative way or whatever. Okay, but if it is asking something very- You are asked by your doctor, so stop eating a particular.
0:40:36 Good luck. . and I think it's going to be good day. Okay, because that is very much personal day. That is very much intimate to my physique or my well-being.
0:40:59 Okay, because he eventually the day- I'll be sharing will be used to train the AI models and everything. Okay, but does not necessarily make me c- comfortable enough to share that for it to be used for free or even if I'm getting paid.
0:41:16 Don't like, you know, in some cases, okay. It is a mix of both, like, uh, depending on. What is being asked?
0:41:26 Hmm. I see. So, what kind of information, just off the top of your head. Would you be comfortable sharing with me?
0:41:36 Like, again, it depends on what has happened to me. Thank you. Okay, okay. I got a mojo. Let's see if we have a discrete, uh, issue who I have.
0:41:48 I'm gonna say thank you to anything, any information related to that. I'll not be hearing, like, even if it is asking for vitamin.
0:41:56 Come in. Okay. Because, uh, see, lot of data is coming. I don't want the AI to predict what has happened to me.
0:42:04 Please. . On the information I give. Yeah. Okay, so. Yeah, it's, it depends. And yeah. Uh, thinking of the last time that maybe say you were not able.
0:42:21 I'm gonna. Do you think there's anything an app could have done to help you? Don't forget to hit the subscribe button.
0:42:30 Like, uhm, see for me it is a bit difficult to imagine. Uhm, because uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh. Uhh, as I said, uhh, like, uhh, see for me I have to use in the hink or specifically.
0:42:43 Okay, I just used to see the vase. Umm, okay, uh, TKs, my proteins, yeah, the, uh, so basic sources of protein like it is, uh, in general not.
0:42:54 Okay, everyone knows if I, uh, uh, chanewa name is the other protein with, uh, tofu. So cool. Okay, so. you On an, on an everyday basis, uhm, if I am not a, I don't want to.
0:43:25 I want to use the word, uh, fitness freak, but, uhm, you know, uhm, yeah, you get the gist, right? Give it a little bit.
0:43:33 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I see. Um, do you think? Maybe features like save it new your routine. See, you leave for a workout, maybe serenity, something like that.
0:43:54 And it suggests you, like, oh, you should have a small snack like a banana. Or something to get you energized for the day.
0:44:00 Do you think stuff like that would be helpful? Yeah, that is okay. Yeah, that is okay. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm.
0:44:05 Mm. Mm. That actually has, like, not just, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, if I see, if the app knows, uh, not, not just my workout routine.
0:44:13 Okay, but, uh, let's say, yes, I've scratched my schedule. Give me a mood that's happened with the book. Let's see.
0:44:20 Yeah. Okay. He gave away craving for something. Yummy, maybe, like, you know, try this recipe out. That will eventually increase uhh, uhh, uhh.
0:44:37 It was an engagement at an app level as well. Okay, and it will be something that I would appreciate, like, you know.
0:44:46 In that app level. If you don't mind asking, do you still cook for yourself? I'll see you in your enjoy cooking.
0:44:55 Well, I like her every day. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I see. Oh, no. or not. I know you briefly mentioned that you were using a few apps here and the, like fitness related.
0:45:08 You have any of them related to- Who tracking your workouts? No, no, no, no. Any particular- You're deepener. You can stop watching.
0:45:20 You can stop like, say big stop watch, eat a tatameh, to track my workout. But, uhh- Umm, no specific app wherein I'll put in the details or the app recommends to be, uhh, be- do two sets of- uhh- uh, just like, you know, with 30 reps or 20 reps.
0:45:37 Okay, so, as many, let's have a chat that we have. Like, oh. Bye. I, I don't know. Like, I'll see.
0:45:44 Personally, I am someone who just observes and learns. Okay. So, imagine me down. But, uh, I don't know. I don't know.
0:45:55 I don't know. I don't know. Okay, I used to caliber it as for my, uhm, ability to perform that workout.
0:46:05 And. and then, then, then, I used to do it for myself, but, uhm, I have not used any app for, say, one reason being, uh, as a co-tracking system, sophisticated tracking system, tabinae, okay, uhm, that will know, uhm.
0:46:22 Okay, by mirror capacity, it's me. Okay, just a, let's see, your workout is the mix of a lot of, different exercises, uhh, focusing on one or more, uhh, modi part of yours.
0:46:36 Okay, yeah. So, let's Thank you. Okay. So, uh, uh, generally shoulder complement, uhh, hmmm. You have legs complement, uhh, hmmm.
0:46:46 . . So, if you're a sanny, you're not a yeeky boy. If I'm doing chest force, okay, the app recommends me something and I'm too burned up, uhh, burned up.
0:46:54 Okay, there is a static recommendation. Okay, bye. We're to the today. Bye. two sets of. Okay, so post that, I will not have that energy in my arms as a whole, okay, by my.
0:47:18 And I'm just giving a vague example. Yeah. But, uh, yeah. You I soon. Umm, have you ever used any variables like a smartwatch smart ring?
0:47:34 Thank you anything later? So, yes, smartwatch I've been using for quite some time. But, uhh, not to f- track anything, uhh, oh, for my fitness and all.
0:47:47 Like, you know, just for the sake of it, like, uhh, it is much more- of a new union in so many ways than of regular walks.
0:47:57 I see. Alan. All right. Do you mind telling me what fitness, uh, like smartwatch you are? Yes, Samsung Galaxy. I've seen.
0:48:07 Umm, I don't know the model to be on it. Like, the phone case had been in the middle of the 18-minute lately.
0:48:13 Like, uhh. I see. And how does it integrate with your phone? Like, does it show you what kind of data does it show you?
0:48:23 So, uh, see, to be honest, like, when setting up the watch itself, I turned all the health-related notifications off. Okay, so notifications, I was not receiving.
0:48:34 Uh, that being said, I was able to use the applications, uh, like a Samsung curve. Okay, so to track the steps, I have, uh, walked.
0:48:47 But today, like, see me being this lazy, uh, right now and having slipped, this can all okay. My family is pushing me more and more everyday.
0:48:55 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yes, it is. So, yes, it is. So, yes. My sister used to ask me to share a picture of, like, you know, how many steps I'll walk today.
0:49:09 Oh, it's, it's. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So minimum 10,000 steps from me over now, go, my dials, you know, right? So go time to my use, sir.
0:49:19 you like, you know, it created a habit and eventually that phase, uh, faded away. Okay, give it away. Let it go.
0:49:34 A great cry. some steps each alone. So, he had no steps each alone. So, what guilty feel of that? So, I was going to stop seeing it at all.
0:49:50 Like, uhh, uhh, uhh, I see. Yeah. And do you still not refer to it? Sorry. Or do you still not refer?
0:50:00 Yeah, yeah, I still don't look at it. Mm-hmm. I see. And, moving a little further, based on the name Biotherm, BIOTI.
0:50:17 What do you think like it is about? out. Umm. Especially to me. Okay. Scary to me. At some extent. Because the- The word bio and train.
0:50:42 Okay. See, train means a lot of things. Okay. So train- the means, uh, okay, uhm, by, uhm, like, you know, you are training yourself, it is for your- training, okay, but, uh, when mixed with bio, okay, bio generally comes down to, like, you know.
0:51:03 Oh. Oh. At a molecular level, or at a cell level, OSR. Mm-hmm. Like, considering biologic, you know. Good, uh. Okay.
0:51:11 To OSR. . . Uh, left side, huda gibbe. It might take too much of my personal things. Mm-hmm. Okay, some- uhh, too much of the information that, uhh, is very personal to me and, uhh, for the- sake of, uhh, the word train, it will train me, but eventually it will be training the datasets it has.
0:51:34 Yes. Here we go. Okay. Like, uhh, regardless of, uhh, even it giving us better outputs. Okay. So, you put us scary like that.
0:51:46 If you had to describe the kind of feeling that you were getting from the name. I'm biotrained in one word.
0:51:54 What adjective would you like? Scary. Scary. Mm-hmm. I see. Like you said, what kind of thoughts you had about the name, about the molecule level and stuff.
0:52:07 What kind of- feature do you think that an up named biocaine would have? Like, just from the name. 7 11 11 11 12 12 Just from the names, the names.
0:52:22 Again, the things that we discussed about your. All right, cool. In, uh, your training habits, uh, from your training habits to have you trained how to.
0:52:32 much you train, if you train at all, uhh, it's not why not like, you know, because the word bio is used.
0:52:39 The The The The The Okay, uhh, like in a more logical way. Okay, it has to contain. scene. Umm, everything.
0:52:51 Okay, because it is at a bio level, not bio level like that, it's not a word, but you know. I have to do that on cell levels.
0:52:58 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. Oh, but. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But it might be, like, a weird, like, a mirror perspective right now.
0:53:09 Yeah. No, definitely. There's, you know, right? I don't want to say this. Don't worry about that. And what do you think, um, is- where, like, room for improvement and the name, what do you say?
0:53:24 Yeah, definitely. Mm-hmm. If- That was a way that you couldn't prove the name, like, what would I think? I don't know why.
0:53:34 Right. , , , , , I don't, I I don't. It's not know. Hello. Umm, maybe something that is non-mutant, uhh, or not soothing, then the world of- Why you- Do you think that being smart things, but smart things, again, like, you know, might, uh, report to you- and one.
0:54:00 And since, you know, they'll be a network that is, uh, smart, like, easy to things and all. So, we'll get some of that, uh, but we are- something that does not contain the word by you is with you.
0:54:12 Mm-hmm, nice. Mm-hmm. Uh, and how do you- I don't feel about gamification elements, like streets, leaderboards, achievement badges, do you think?
0:54:24 They would promote healthy competition, or do you think they would be de-motivating? Yeah, it depends on, like, you know, what kind of- uhh, mindset of course has.
0:54:36 Okay, so me, uhh, it would be a mix of both, like, uhh. So, it would be good for me, like, you know, this is a 10,000 cent.
0:54:48 6 5 of 10,000 steps to 7 days. Thank you. I just think, okay. So, no D was at that time.
0:55:01 But then again, you know, if you met that sleep or, if you- I don't achieve that my soul. Okay. How the app conveys the message to me is much more important.
0:55:13 In terms of, uh, shaping my sentiment towards this. Mm-hmm. Okay. So, I'll go to Mooji, I suppose. Oh no, you missed your stay today.
0:55:25 Okay, it would not go well with me some- I'm okay, depending on what's, uhh, state of mind I am on, like, I don't know what state of the group is supposed to be for a new particular.
0:55:36 Okay, but if I'm already- this state's not my something else. Okay, so, so, so, you know, those are product product obviously.
0:55:44 Okay. Good. But if it is more neutral or uhh, uhh, not, not neutral, but if it is a position in some other way.
0:55:52 You I didn't get any, yeah, who, uhh, Q-N-T, uhh, yeah, prokero. Yes, that's good. would. Okay, so that would definitely shape my sentiment in a different way.
0:56:17 The video somewhat briefly experienced those apps. Are there any features that you particularly liked or ignored or maybe it didn't even, you know, explore was not interesting to you.
0:56:33 . . . . . Yeah, so see, this liked or liked is something that I would not be able to comment on because, uhh, like you, I ha- haven't, uhh, used to be the abs in a long time, like, those are karaouni smakiata, so of course I don't remember how I tried it there.
0:56:48 Okay. Thank you. Uh, but, uh, yeah, the thing is, and this applies to any application that I'm using. Okay, I generate- I really don't explore.
0:56:59 Okay, I want to do this, like, I want to- uhh, I a message. Okay, recommend me a good application and then you'll say, okay, job, what's difficult, its nice.
0:57:11 Okay, so may what's up, po- look for chat, I will chat, I will do the things that I want to do and I will be application.
0:57:18 Like, I don't, umm, like, you know. All of a sudden, Go around the application, explore it, uhm, and do a lot of, uhm, uhm, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah Hmmm, I see.
0:57:32 And, uh, and, uh, and again it depends on, like, you know, kis kara kiki application. Okay, so, me being into IT, okay, I'll go to the roots of it.
0:57:45 Good. Okay, because that is something I'm fascinated about. Okay, so if I'm not fascinated about, uh, fitness, and if I'm just counting the calories.
0:57:53 That I will take it. Let's say, okay, just wonder I'm okay. I think my fitness here is a better spot.
0:58:01 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. the calories. I know the rouse of it.
0:58:18 Yeah, I won't exclude anything. I see. So, do you think, in a situation like this- . maybe offering small in-app tutorials or something, do you think that would help you or would that- .
0:58:34 . It would still be something that you would not do. See, when it's a little perspective, it does this. Okay. Umm.
0:58:41 Go. Not the video tutorial reeled in the app itself. Hmmm. But like if it shows you, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it helps.
0:58:50 But it's for me personally, like, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm.
0:59:04 I'm happy it's time to lay your school. I see, I see. And have you ever paid for a fitness? Yes.
0:59:14 Subscription or maybe an app or a service, anything like that before. What? What does that mean? What mean? I see.
0:59:26 Because I'm not into those. Hold… I'm just saying the Okay… Okay, pause. So do you think speaking of the hypothetical app that we were talking about?
0:59:37 If… Some of the features were not paid. I don't know if some of the features were offered to you for free.
0:59:45 Do you think… that is what would help you come onto the app, probably explore it a bit? Or would you still be scared?
0:59:54 Okay. You know, I see it depends on, uhh, water is given to me. Thank you. Thank you. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
1:00:05 And, uhh, what, uhh, is the limitation of using it. Thank you. Thank you. So, see, there are two types of applicator, three types of application.
1:00:14 One is the premium ones. Like, what's the random leak? You have to go. I've got data used. The second one is, uhh, there is a cap on the uhh.
1:00:26 . You say that uuuh, okay? Hmmm. So this happened there, uhm, my name, uh, this is H Yep. And for the 16th day, if you want to track, okay, you are asked to pay for us.
1:00:44 Okay, so, that, uh, I generally avoid, okay, because- what happens is, uhh, it, uhh, like at a business level, atshayabu, it's a looky by ikadab, like Jhati, yeah.
1:00:57 Yeah. Yeah. Good. Yeah. So, let's say, for example, it's a Jhati, okay. I have a freemium offered. U50. What do you think?
1:01:05 The- The- The- Yeah. it. The- The- The- The- don't like you know what you was kicking n***a right there. If it is free, it is free, if it is not free.
1:01:23 If you tell a friend, you think he is very, very happy, very happy, and happy, and have a good day.
1:01:29 move. That is much more, um, straight forward, you know. Yeah. I see. So. So. So, correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I've understood, you seem to be more interested in the nutrition.
1:01:48 If there was an app like that, correct? Yes, yes. So, would you say you would- use features like the recipe bank, maybe the video content, the tracking, stuff like that, but mainly on the nutrition side?
1:02:03 Yeah, mainly on the nutrition side, and uhh, yeah, this recipe bank as well, uhh, dip. Pending on is it filters out how I, not how, but what I want to eat.
1:02:19 Correct, like your preferences and stuff like that. Yes, yes. I see. That I would use the, like, actually even. You more than my, uhh, calorie pound.
1:02:32 Yeah, because as I said, the other way. So. Well, we'll see because there's something about that. He gave me, uhh, yeah, I'm not going to do it.
1:02:40 I'm not going to do that. He can't, who I am, you be. Please. No, okay, my kayaks are around. Why don't we need to go back and track it again?
1:02:48 I say. Thank you. Thank you. And do you think, say you try the app, you like the app, what would, be the most reasonable price range that you would be willing to maybe even consider.
1:03:05 Thank President. See, it depends, uhh, uhh, uhh, hmmm. Uhh, he spoke. He took me. Thank you. And for me, to be very honest, I have not been a bang for it.
1:03:21 Do me. Very safe. next slide. Okay. Okay. Because, yeah, it is not of importance to me. Okay. So I don't know, like, if some magic happens and, If I, uhh, place my focus a bit more on what I eat or, uhh, uhh, fitness as a whole.
1:03:39 Okay, it might work. But, uhh, yeah, it might be better otherwise I eat one. All right, we're going to get I see.
1:03:51 And, again, correct me if I'm wrong. But, would you say, Do you prefer more of a private self-paced experience? Mm-hmm.
1:04:02 Yeah, of course. Okay. All right. I see. Do you think, uhh, features like maybe having a live scope? All right, cool.
1:04:11 Which are like nutritionist. Or maybe even virtual support that, you know, they're always there to answer your questions. Be it nutrition relief.
1:04:19 Be it fitness related, health related. Like someone's always there to answer your queries. Do you think that is something you would- Are you interested in?
