07:04 Oh, when I have the- Mm-hmm. Not really. I don't go through any pain also. My second day is a little heavy.
07:14 Maybe on me, because it's amazing. Kind of lazy, and I have a lot of force. Leg spin special. Mm-hmm. you.
07:22 . . I see. So, when you experience this pain, do you tend to not walk on that day or play tiff? Like it is young that day?
07:32 Yeah, I do that. I prefer not walking. I prefer, like, sitting more. for I can imagine. Do you have any health conditions or physical limitations?
07:46 Nations that. I might prevent you from achieving your daily steps or something. No, nothing. No health conditions. Mr. Fitness. Oh, this before?

08:26 If it. I feel like I do not follow a certain diet, but I am specific like what not. Thank you.
08:42 Bye bye. I think I'm breaking out from it. Alright. Maybe shifting forward. . ? Can you hear me now? Yeah, I did.
09:20 We can. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Yeah. Oh, you were talking about any mobile applications or software that you may have used?
09:29 Thanks. No, I have not used any. I see. Do you take any supplements like multi vitamins? Amen. Or any protein, water, anything like that?
09:47 No, nothing like that. I said, I used to just say it will do when I was pregnant. No, I'm not taking anything.
09:55 Okay. And we'll see you Mm-hmm. Oh, could you tell me what kind of vitamin once you were taking? Okay. Can you hear me?
10:09 Yeah, yeah. Now I can. . . . Any, uh, could you elaborate a bit on the kind of vitamin? I mean, you were taking back then?
10:23 Actually, those were suggested by the doctors, so I used to take folic acid. Thank I will see you in the next video.
10:28 And calcium tablets and iron tablets. It was only during pregnancy and then post for a year. I just want to say that.
10:38 Did he also make a diet plan for you or a nutrition plan or something like that? No, nothing like that.
10:46 Nothing specific because since I didn't have any health conditions, I was on a normal diet. So, would you describe your current eating habits as just trying to eat better?
10:59 Do- You eat mostly. Oh, eating habits, I'm not like, uh, I'm a kind of away foodie. Thank very much. I said yes, I eat a lot of food you can say.
11:11 Umm, I think. Uhh. Have you ever sought out for any advice regarding nutrition or physical activity or anything like that?
11:24 So, basically my husband is also in the fitness center. Mmm. And Yeah. Yeah. It's not like strictly, I do not follow anything.
11:43 I'm so sorry. I think you cut off in the middle of your answer. Could you- Just repeat that. Yeah. So, my husband is also in fitness center.
11:53 He gives me nutrition and advice. So, it's- I do not like, I do not follow it completely, but sometimes I do.
12:01 I see. Oh, did he ask? Let's see. Any questions or something before he tried to devise a plan for you?
12:10 Yeah, it was like about- my weight, I was having a, uhm, I think I was around 60, a year back and suddenly gained a lot.
12:20 And so it was a weight loss kind of a diet. Let me see. Do you have any pattern fitness cones right now?
12:32 Or now I am actually thinking of moving some weight if I could get- I don't get any more application or something where I can work out at home because I won't be able to go to any fitness interval.
12:45 I see. So do you think you would be interested in an hypothetical application? information. probably that would take into account your routine, your schedule, the goals that you have.
13:00 The current diet that you have, and maybe make recommendations based on those. Do you think that would be something that would be interesting?
13:08 Yeah, that would be of a great health, right? If I could do it on a daily basis from home, that would be good.
13:14 Thanks. Thanks. Umm, do you think you will face challenges if you would ask to follow us? Do you think you may face challenges?
13:31 engines. I did not get your question actually. So, when following a diet or, Just trying to get better at your eating habits.
13:44 Do you think you have any challenges like maybe like, of motivation or you have cravings or maybe, My craving for a time is a good problem.
13:55 Even if I, I do eat healthy, so I crave alone. I crave alone. So I end up cheating. I see.
14:04 Aha, aha, aha. I. d'weh, gave you all recommendations or he- the options based off- of the things that you like.
14:16 week. Oh, could you repeat that? You got stuck actually. Yeah. Thank you. Oh, so do you think it would be helpful if the hypothetical, uh, give you suggestions based off of the- stuff that you already like, or maybe the stuff that you're craving, like a healthier option for it, do you think that might
14:43 be something that you would be interested in? Yeah, that would be of great health. If you know, if you have an option where it is healthier and better, so, okay.
14:53 I think you would go for that. I see. Do you think having any recipes or- information like that attached with it?
15:02 Do you think that would be helpful? Yes, that is also fine. That could also be- Would you say you have the time to cook for- Oh prepare for your diet if you were following one?
15:22 Yes, I have. I do not have a- So I'm gonna, If I can prepare, it's actually- If it isn't my diet thing, I can prepare.
15:30 Mm-hmm. I see. And do you think you will be able to trust AI-based recommendations? organizations. I don't prefer AI-based recommendations, actually.
15:45 I don't like business music to me. We'll see next time. There are a lot of AI, so, you know, I don't feel that trustworthy to me for weight loss, they might get- some other diet.
15:58 So, not really AI based. raised. So, what do you say the problem is that they feel not personalised to your, uh, routine or your schedule?
16:13 I'm not sure because I'm not right. But I feel even personal, one-on-one would be a better option, like, if, uh, if it's not- I say.
16:26 So, do you think that there might be- you wouldn't require that you would trust more? Yes, that's what I mean, thanks to me.
16:36 Okay. All right. Well, thank All right. It's not like I said completely against it, right? But AI is also okay.
16:42 But all the human touch would be great. So that it could- Do you know 100% genuine kind of thing? I don't know.
16:50 I don't know. I know you mentioned that you- I'm looking for an app that will probably help you do home workouts and stuff like that.
17:00 Anything specific that- not you are looking for? Nothing specific. See, umm, basically I just want to lose weight and I do not have any health condition.
17:09 That won't be a problem. So it's in a period of 32, 30 minutes to one hour a day. See you.
17:17 I could get personalized workouts, which I can do with a phone would be great. Thanks. Thanks. There are any criteria's that you've set when you're looking for an app like, uhh, maybe it should.
17:37 Or it should have a nutrition aspect to it. Or maybe you. you just want to work out, uh, anything like that.
17:46 It's like, work out with nutrition is what I'm looking. I'm looking forward to actually. Yeah. I see. Uh, would you be able to elaborate a little more on that?
17:56 you elaborate on what? Uhh, on the kind of features are probably the kind of advice that you're looking for. Anything that might be addressed to you.
18:12 Yeah, so. That's a normal routine workout which will help me for weight loss. And with that nutrition value also should be equal.
18:22 Right? So, after a workout, I should know what I should be. Or maybe we will come. Or maybe post workout.
18:28 out. I see. So, if there was a map that would help you, you know, probably give you a notification. Okay, sure and then, like, oh, it's 6 p.m.
18:40 You're about to work out in an eye. Maybe you should have all lights, not like a banana or something, do they?
18:46 That might be something that would be useful. Yes, that would be useful. If I could get a reminder, like, now it's time to- as a workout, so you have your pre-workout.
18:58 So, would you- do you think I'll- If you, Do you think they might be hurtful in the long run, or do you think they might- eventually start getting maybe a little annoying?
19:14 See, if there's only one notification like- You re-workout one notification and post-workout one notification. That would be good. But some apps, you know, it's like continuous back to back.
19:25 back. And if you allow notifications, they get irritated and you will have to delete that. I see. Let's see. One.
19:34 Ah, notification would be okay. I see. Umm, do you wait? You have any variable devices like a smartwatch or a ring that helps you track your steps or something.
19:49 and no one, I'm not using any of the controls right now. I see. See you. Umm, so how do uuuh, our time to track your steps and you when you do like 7,000 steps a day, right?
20:15 That's it, that's awesome. Thank you very Oh, no, no, no. Should we inform, do we? Or should we wait a little longer?
21:15 Hello? Can you hear me? Yes. Yeah, yeah, we can. Yeah, uhh, so we were talking about the, uhh, variables and the values you can have.
21:27 How do you actually back your steps? I'd say I have this app in my phone. It's awesome. That is great.
21:37 What do you mind telling me the exact name of it? Let me just check. Yeah, yeah sure. Take care. That's it.
21:56 Once we have the same, she says I love it. Look at my mother coming home and they are coming home.
22:11 Look at wolf. A wolf. A little almond. It's a step. Crackle, count my steps. From health and fitness. Yes. Good, good.
22:21 All right. Good. You know, also I'm telling me the kind of, uh, mobile device that you have. Is it? I was.
22:30 So the right, right? The nice and the right. Mm hmm. And is that a reason why you were not. Drowned to their inbuilt health.
22:43 Nothing specific like that. It was just like, I took. I just started working, so I downloaded from, uh, Google Play Store, and I started.
22:52 It's not like specific. I didn't wanted the android. I- I like it. So you were just looking for something that would be helpful in tracking the steps, like.
23:01 Bye. I see. Have you ever been interested in tracking anything else? Like, maybe you're swinging for the. So. amount of calories you're taking anything like that has that I've interested you.
23:17 Something or calories has on. Always interested me like I want to more if I eat some of it how many calories are there in that.
23:24 Mm hmm. I see. Thank you. Thank you. Is there a reason why you haven't started cracking yet? No specific reason.
23:34 Mm hmm. Have you ever tried cracking your foot? Not yet. Mm hmm. I see. And what about the calorie intake probably interests you?
23:51 Would you want? To change anything in your diet based off of it or anything you would like to add. Since I told you even if- I try to start hell now.
24:01 So I crave for things like these things, stoplets. So I end up having- I'm so happy. So I want to cut off my calories.
24:11 I see. And do you think there's anything- thing. I'm . The app would be able to do to help you get more consistent or, you know, subside those cravings.
24:22 Anything that you think- We got a zero chain and less calories. So we would opt for the second option. Thank you.
24:41 And have you ever been concerned about your data being used when you design? These are, Or my location, that's it.
24:58 I said, well, do you think you would be- Go. Umm, I'm sharing medical data, like, umm, maybe blood reports, anything like that with an app that- would promise you to be more tailored when it comes to structuring a plan for you.
25:18 Like, maybe if you have a deficiency. It'll help you overcome it naturally with probably foods that are rich and that.
25:25 Anything like that, that might be interesting. No useful. I'm sorry you were cut off actually. No problem. No problem. So, would you be comfortable sharing your medical data like many of your blood reports or something with an app?
25:44 It's. If it promised that it was going to give you more personalized recommendations based off of it, like probably helping you.
25:52 Oh. Where come a deficiency if you're falling behind anything like that? Does it sound interesting to you? Thank you. That would be good, but, uh, until and unless there happens, you know, you've been put party up, you know.
26:08 Make the permissions this thing. So, until and unless it is only in the app, that is fine. Okay. So, what would help you assure that your data is not being used in this case?
26:23 I'm going Let's see. Okay. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. You Okay. Thank you. Uh, uh, hm. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
28:17 Hello. Yeah. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes. Yes. I can. Yes. Yes. Umm, so we were talking about, uh, what helped you feel assured that, the app is not misused in your data.
28:37 Yeah, so see, basically there are some apps, okay? That's, I think, the, of my friends have gone through a lot of, like, finance apps, especially.
28:46 There's access to gallery, they ask facts. Thanks. This is two contacts and when they allow it, so they have everything, all the data.
28:54 So I think fitness app won't feed any ass. So it's only notification is allowed would be fine. Thank you for I see.
29:06 So would you say that you would become stippler? You would not become filler. It's letting your medical data. Yep. I would be comfortable.
29:14 That is fine. Mhm. I see. And based on the name by your train, That's B-I-O-T-I-I-N. What is the first thing that comes to your mind?
29:28 and hopefully. B-I-O-T-I-N. It feels like, I don't know, by your chain. It does not really cover anything. I'm not sure what it is about.
29:44 If you- You have to take a while in this. What do you think it is about? I think it might be some- Meaning after something like that.
29:56 Uh, could you elaborate more like, what do you envision it? As what kind of, like if I told you it's the name of an app, what do you think the app has?
30:08 Thank you very much. Oh, I completely feel it's related to fitness because biotrained, literally that is like physical, something, like physical, something, training related to fitness.
30:17 I see. Uh, does that mean, invoke any f- feelings like motivation or trustworthiness or it could also be something negative.
30:31 Anything that it evokes. folks. The name? No, nothing like it is. It looks nice, you know. Bye, you ting. Bye.
30:41 Bye bye. By the word, we come to know that it might be something related to training of fitness. Mm-hmm. Actually, uhh.
30:49 And do you feel like it is relevant if it was the name of a fitness app which promised you? Oh.
30:57 Oh. Personalized nutrition and personalized workout space off of your own routine, your current diet, your fitness. because what do you think about that?
31:11 Yeah, that is my biotrania, I feel. You think the name is good. Do you think there might be any room for improvement?
31:19 Next. No, not really. I see. How do you feel about, lintly, let's say, the hypothetical lab by your train. Okay.
31:34 If it had features like, maybe, streaks. and drinks. Or achievement badges or some leaderboards that where you could share your progress.
31:44 See other people's progress. That is it. Hey, uh, great, actually. You know, if you can share your progress, you can see other progress.
31:51 That might, you know, get motivation for you also by seeing other, progress, what's going on. Mm-hmm. I see. You think looking at others, progress, people, I feel demotivated, or do you think it might promote healthy competition?
32:07 I feel it will promote healthy competition, like, See, it will create competition within themselves also. Like, they have done that monsoon.
32:15 We need to at least reach that point. That's my point of view. So, there will be competition. auditions. If I ask you to choose between a need-a-board where you share your progress with others and you can view theirs as well.
32:33 and and if the other option was where you could look at your own progress from the previous weekend compared to- of this week, like, oh, maybe you want more this week than the previous week, anything like that.
32:48 Which one do you think would be more- or useful, or which one do you think I do might be more drawn to?
32:54 It matters of useful. I think my last weeks and this weeks. The leaderboard will be a better option because, you know, I'll get to know what I have improved or maybe, uh, demotivated and move.
33:05 I've got back. Maybe I might have less steps. So next week I'm having to do one of these things. So that would be helpful instead of, you know, me comparing with other.
33:15 If I can get my own leaderboard, so I'll come to know what's going on and what's not going on. I'm going on with the module, draw yourself more towards like module leaning more towards checking the progress leaderboard of yours.
33:30 those. I would do it for myself. I'll see you in the next Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Mhm. Have you paid for the walkout sober?
33:46 All right. There's a lot of fitness owners or anything like that before. But even a gym trainer. No. I, yeah, I told you I used to do yoga, right?
33:58 So that was the only time I had paid. made. So a look. Okay. Okay. All right. And, um, and you said that was everyday on the week, right?
34:06 Yeah, it was everyday. I see. No. And do you think when speaking about this hypothetical app, I know you mentioned you're interested in home workouts?
34:18 Do you think having a live coach there or virtual support, do you think that would be helpful? So. Life coach in the sense he will be available every time.
34:33 Like, at least some. One is always available to cater to your question or your doubts. Yeah, and that would be a great sense, you know.
34:42 Thank joining us. Even when we are working out, if we had any doubts regarding posture, maybe, or nutrition, maybe, if we could chat over somebody.
34:51 We could just do them a text, like, this is the what we are facing and we get a reply, it would be great, you know, in any app.
34:57 Mm-hmm. I see. And when it comes to home workouts, what kind of videos do you think you would like more?
35:06 Like. I go. Or 13-minute long video walking you through a workout. Or maybe shorter videos just showing you like, okay, do four sets of t- and then there's like a short video with your form, the connect way to do it.
35:21 So for me it would be, you know, it would be- It be great if it is a 30 minutes video.
35:25 Like, if I could follow each and every step what is going on in the video. Mm-hmm. It will feel like we are doing it along with the video.
35:34 So, that will be more motivating than I have, like, you do 4 reps of this. And then get back. It will be like, again, scrolling the this thing.
35:43 Umm, but instead of that, that will be better. I see. So just something that you could probably, you know, put it on the TV and just follow for like the next 30 minutes.
35:53 Something like that would be great. I see. And are there any particular workout types that are interested in like it?
36:03 I couldn't be over the lattice. Maybe just some normal studio, no mascara, anything like that. You Yoga and basic exercises.
36:14 Select the hand control. I'm okay with it. I see. See ya. And have you ever, like, say, if you started doing home workouts?
36:25 Okay. What do you think would be the- most challenging thing for you would it be finding the time, maybe the motivation, maybe the space is an issue.
36:35 And to go. Two, a little. and bit of or the equipment, anything like that, that you can think of. The basic thing, I think, when we start for workout, it will be the equipment.
36:43 So, which we need something on the other, we should be informed prior that this thing's un-girded. and motivation is open Okay, and the timing, you know, to follow regularly on the same time.
36:55 Correct. It would be a little challenging because every day, There might be something more the other come up, coming up.
37:03 Mhm. I see. So, what would, be your ideal schedule like to do, rather work out five times a week, something like that, or take it easy.
37:15 Easy. Like three times a week. And then the other day, you just do like a fight and mid walk. What kind of a plan feels like?
37:23 You would be interested in for me. Yeah, I think it would be like three days old. A week where I can walk out and, you know, walk around jogging maybe for something like that.
37:36 Three times a week. I do. I see. And do you usually like staying active alone, maybe with a partner or a.
37:47 Or in community, like you mentioned the class. I didn't get your. The question actually. So I was asking what kind of a workout environment would you like?
38:03 Thank you. What do you like working out alone with a partner, with a trainer or like the classes you use to do?
38:11 I'm what I'm looking for. If it is an app-based workout, I would love to do it alone. I wouldn't want anyone around me.
38:19 I see. Building the idea of going at your own pace is something that I can trust you. Is that what?
38:27 Yes. Yeah. Mhm. I see. And would you say that the people are- How do they motivate you? Like, how do they affect your motivation?
38:40 Is it positive? Is it negative? For me? It is positive because my family is into the fitness thing. So, for me, it would be a motivation early from there.
38:51 the and and I see. And using looking at the visible progress that you've made, is that more? Bye. That makes me feel like, oh, maybe there is a difference.
39:13 I would say both actually. Thank you for uh, do you mind elaborating a little on it? See if for, if I can go through my fitness thing and I realize, own like on.
39:24 My own seat, I have this difference. I have this difference. And that coming up from others also, like, having compliment that you've lost weight, maybe or something.
39:32 Everything else, I'm gonna be, you know, great. It could be more motivating for me that, okay. So, for what I'm doing, it is working out for me.
39:41 I see. So, like I said, they hypothetically. Thank you. The last thing we're talking about. Oh, I think I already mentioned that it might take into account your medical factors if you want.
39:57 Do you think anything else that it could do to help become a better. Mhm. Mhm. A better, uh, fitness assistant to you?
40:09 No, I shared with you, you know, like, anything new. If it could tell me, you know, reworkout, what to work out, that would be a great help if, you know, if I have a proper, plan, proper time, like, this time you have to do workout, I get a notification.
40:25 So that will be, like, mentally preparing for me also, like, okay. You know, I have time for my workout. I have to eat that.
40:31 That would be a great app, actually. I see. Thank you for watching. And when it, just one more question, when it comes to tracking your nutrition, I mean, expressing and press.
40:44 Yes. Do you think showing a list of raw ingredients, like, for example, like this, dal? and showing ingredients, like dal, oil, et cetera, et cetera.
40:56 And then you take them, probably add a quantity, something like that. Do you think that is- more beneficial or just looking up the dish, dal, one bowl.
41:05 And then using it. Do you think that is more accurate? Okay, got. Now it's coming which one would you lean towards?
41:10 I would go for the first one. You know, the wrong thing is, do you think that? For being more accurate maybe?
41:19 Yes, more accurate and, you know, that will give us an idea also, like, how much calories we are in taking.
41:24 And how much of this thing really? Yeah. So, instead of this dal, one cup. So, one cup and, honestly, the problem.
41:33 It's like, especially in Indian household, you know, one cup means they take it different measurements. They do not have a specific, like, this is the cup.
41:42 So, then the measurement problem will come up. I see. Thank you. Umm, I think, um, at the end of my question, uhh, just one more thing.
41:56 If you feel. You like we may have missed out on something or if we didn't cover a topic, or you can feel free to reach out to us.
42:05 I'm sorry. Or even mention it right now if you have any thoughts. Nothing. Actually, you have covered up everything. Like, what is my- like what are my eating habits and everything.
42:16 And what I need in a- in an app I've already told you. Mm-hmm. Alright. it. Okay, uh, so thank you so much for your time right now.
