0:00:00 Hi, so my name is Vidhi Thakkar, and I'm a UX researcher with Lemon Yellow. And we're working with Weber, Van Nyhuis, to try to understand people's relationship with fitness, health, well-being.
0:00:20 How do they, how, how fitness fits into their daily life? What motivates them? What challenges them? If they use any technology, how do they integrate it in their routine?
0:00:33 So thank you so much for joining today and before we begin I just want to say that there are no right or wrong answers.
0:00:42 We just want your honest opinion. Your honest feedback, your honest experiences, because that is what is going to be the most helpful for us to shape the world.
0:00:52 The experience that we're trying to, okay. Okay. Do you have a language preference that you want, like, English or Hindi?
0:01:09 I don't mind any. I can go with English, I can go with Hindi. What is your call? Okay. Can you start by telling me a little about yourself?
0:01:21 Like, your name, age, gender, and occupation? Uhm, my name is Mobahila, and I'm from Pakistan, and my age is, My age is 30, and I'm an ex-Pakistan government servant, and recently moved to Dubai with my husband.
0:01:41 And currently, I'm a homemaker. I'm not doing Mhm.
0:01:52 I see. Uh, could you walk me through what are typical, day looks like for you? Uh, I get up early in the morning, and then I, do my breakfast, and go for, uh, sunbathing, then come back, have my lunch.
0:02:12 Then in the evening, I work out, usually in the, uh, residential gym of the building. Uh, either I make a I might go for a walk in the evening and then come back, wait for my husband to come back so that I can have dinner with him.
0:02:29 Then, uh, that's all. Yeah. I prefer to sleep early and wake up early. That works good for me. Mhm. I see.
0:02:40 So, would you work out daily or, like, how many times a week? Since I moved to Dubai, I'm trying to follow my routine.
0:02:53 I am actually, uh, uh, I used to work out daily, like six days a week, proper, uh. weight training, and I've been doing it, uh, since 2017, so, yeah.
0:03:09 I prefer to work at least five to six days in a week. Mm-hmm. I see. And how long, do you usually work out for?
0:03:19 Uh, if I'm doing weight training, then my, uh, workout spends, uh, is around from, like, one hour to one and a half hour.
0:03:30 If I'm properly doing weight training, then I go for, like, two muscles per day. Or if I'm, I'm doing, like, full body or max, like, cardio, then it's, like, one hour.
0:03:41 If I'm doing, like, aerobics, or I'm doing cardio, or I'm doing, uh, pilates, then it's, like, one hour. But, yeah.
0:03:49 Usually, it, whenever I go for a workout, it's, uh, it, it is from, like, one hour to 1.30. Because I sometimes.
0:03:58 Initially, and previously, I used to have, like, a post-workout. Sometimes, I go for sauna. Sometimes, I go for sleep. So, it's like, around one and a half hour.
0:04:09 Yeah. I see. So, would you say, Your physical activity is mainly restricted to a gym or do you also explore other sports?
0:04:22 Other things like maybe classes or communities, clubs, maybe even outdoor activity. Yes, I. I used to, uh, explore outdoor activities.
0:04:33 Uh, like I am not, uh, I am not able to, uh, recall the name, uh, but I go for outdoor yogas and, uh, sunbathing.
0:04:46 Sometimes the fitness dance classes, uh, and sometimes running and marathon-like cycling. I used to do that also, like, once, uh, once or twice in, for, for Nike.
0:05:02 I see. And, I also, and, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I also used to, I used to play, go for hike, like, two, two days a week, on weekends.
0:05:15 It depends on the weather. So, in, in Islamabad. Like, they are very beautiful, uh, Margalla Hills. So, we are more inclined towards hiking also.
0:05:24 So, it's like, three, four days gym, two days, one, two days hiking. Usually with the families on a weekend. It's a very good, healthy outdoor activity.
0:05:34 Correct. I see. And have you worked out at home before? Yeah, I do.
0:05:50 Frankly, in Dubai, yes, I'm doing. Could you tell me a little more about what that experience has been like? Uhm, you know, in, in the, if you are doing workout at home, so.
0:06:09 You cannot, you can go for weight training, but you cannot have, like, heavy weights, so you cannot train your proper muscles.
0:06:14 That's for sure. So, you can tone your muscles in a way that you have, uh, light weights, like 2KG. 5KG dumbbells at home.
0:06:25 And, and you can mix and match it with pilates and, uh, aerobics and. Yoga. So, and a little bit of stretching.
0:06:33 So when I'm working out at home, like currently nowadays, so I'm just, I'm, I'm going for using some, uh, fitness stretching, uh, equipment.
0:06:46 And a lightweight dumbbells and, and more of yoga I'm doing. I see it. What would you say is the biggest challenge you've been facing?
0:07:03 Is it motivation, maybe it's space, equipment, guidance, anything like that? As I am old, uh, enough to ask for guidance, so I've been working quite a long period of time.
0:07:19 So I, what I feel the restriction is that I, I am more habitual of proper machines. And proper heavy weight training.
0:07:29 So, which is, which I feel is, uuuh. Like, it accelerates my fitness more than working out at home. So, the, having the proper smart machine, it's really kind of a restriction if you're working out at home.
0:07:46 So, yeah, you cannot do proper heavy, like, muscle training. at home. You can tone your muscles at home, and you can have, like, proper stretchings for, for good yoga, but not at a proper, ah, weight training.
0:08:01 You cannot do it. For that, you have to have, like, machines which you only can get in the, ah, home.
0:08:07 Clubs and gyms. Yeah. Yeah. And, uhm, since we're talking about guidance. How do you usually work out at home? Like, do you follow tutorials, maybe guides, YouTube videos?
0:08:23 Uh, I do not follow YouTube videos. I go for an app. It's like, just stretch. So, I stretch. And sometimes, uh, uh, like, follow them.
0:08:36 For, like, stretching purposes. And I do not watch YouTube videos much. Uh, if sometimes I really want, like, I have a stiffness in some of my muscles, then I, like, pre-workout.
0:08:47 But specifically, I can Google it, like, if I have, like, I have to stretch my back or I have pain in some of my muscles, like, left shoulder or something.
0:08:55 Then, only then I, if I want to, uuuh, ease my pain quickly, then I can Google it. And I go I go for, uh, YouTube videos, but not much.
0:09:08 Not really. Yeah. And how comfortable would you say you are using a phone during your workout? Uh. Uh, like, if I'm watching a tutorial, then I use my phone.
0:09:26 And if I'm not watching a tutorial, then I prefer not to use my phone. And I want to align my breathing rhythm.
0:09:35 With, while I'm stretching or doing yoga or whatever. So I, I want to be mentally present there. So I do not, I prefer not to use my phone.
0:09:44 I sometimes play some calming, soothing music. So I do not use phone unless and until I'm watching something. So I do not use phone.
0:09:54 Either I'm working at home or I'm working at gym. I prefer not to use my phone. I see. And would you say you prefer exercising alone with your friends or with trainer or community?
0:10:12 I think, uhm, training, uh, works out with the partner or a community is always a good thing. But if they are serious trainers, if they are like serious in- regarding their fitness and they are proper working out, then it's good to work out with them.
0:10:29 Or if, uh, you get a partner, that's a plus point. Or, uh, if you're new and definitely, uh, if you are new, then you should go for a training.
0:10:39 to guide you properly because angle matters the most. Because, uh, if you're not properly doing, well, uh, wraps as per the angle, then you can definitely going to have, have your boom.
0:10:56 So, yeah. I see. So, when working out. Would you say that the app, like, it probably has video content, right?
0:11:10 Uh-huh. How do you play it? Do you play it on your phone, maybe a tablet, a TV? I play on my phone usually.
0:11:20 I'm using mostly play on Yeah, they are.
0:11:31 Like, if they have some unique content and proper, Tutorials, then sometimes for beginners and they are useful and sometimes you're working out and you do not remember what to do.
0:11:46 So if they have proper categorization for every muscle or every, uh, then it's useful. It's very helpful. So you can, uh, like you can follow your fitness routine.
0:11:58 Like, yeah, I do. I did arms today. For example, I did four arms today. Uh, I did legs today. So if you, they are having proper part.
0:12:08 Tions with proper video tutorials than for the big nerds and to monitor your workout. It's, it will be quite. I see.
0:12:21 And do you drag any. Metrics, like, steps, sleep, heart rate, calories, anything like that? Yeah, I, I do.
0:12:32 Uh, monitor my steps. Uh, I, I never care about my heart rate. So, I have, I have good offer because I have an athletic history.
0:12:43 So, I am fine with that. So, I do try to monitor my steps. and try to, uuuh, walk a little more.
0:12:53 So, yeah. I do monitor my, my, uh, screen time and my listening time also, which is pa, which is also part of the health and fitness, so I do also monitor.
0:13:04 my listening time and screen time. Correct. I see. And do you also track, your menstrual cycles? Yeah, I do. Uh-huh.
0:13:17 And do you think your cycles, affect your energy, or your motivation, or to work out, or maybe follow your diet, or something like that?
0:13:28 Uh, I think, uh, uh, the, uhm, as of, uh, if you talk about the feminine cycle, then it, does have impact on your mood, uh, and it does have impact on my mood and my energy levels, but then.
0:13:44 You have to have a mindset for your fitness. Okay, yes, I'm feeling low, but, That's gonna boost my mood up, so that's what I go.
0:13:56 I also, if I'm feeling low and if I'm having my cycle. So I take rest for like first and second day, but on third day I go for cardio and a light workout.
0:14:08 I know that this is gonna help me in my overall energy levels and my mood swing. So that's, I am.
0:14:20 So, if there was a hypothetical. That could take into account all the metrics that you are tracking, like you mentioned steps, uhm.
0:14:33 menstrual cycles, maybe your diet, maybe your routine, your workout schedules, and if it made you Based on the context, like, okay, your cycle has started today.
0:14:46 I'll give you, like, two days of maybe just quiet. Why don't you walk for five minutes? Maybe you walk for ten minutes.
0:14:52 And then the third day, it's giving you a lighter intensity workout. Do you think that feels personalized or feels useful?
0:15:01 Something that you might be interested in? Yeah, that's very often. That's very awesome and often I saw these type of suggestions on Instagram which you are referring to that you will want to basically align fitness and personalized fitness as per the ministerial cycle.
0:15:18 That's really wonderful. And obviously. Uh, I would be having the option of application like this, then I would like to at least try it for a while.
0:15:29 And if it suits me, whatever suggestion that app is giving me as per my menstrual cycle, my My, my overall lifestyle.
0:15:39 So, I'll try to give it a try for like one, two months and if it actually helps. Me out, so definitely I'm going to stick to that.
0:15:48 I see. Yeah. And compared to. The routine that you were speaking about. I know you said you have been following it since, uh, 2017, right?
0:16:01 So what motivated you to start? Uh, what motivated me? I told you I have, uh, athletic history.
0:16:15 I was a badminton player back in my college and I was always actively, active in, in sports. So I used to play squash also, so.
0:16:25 So, and I'm, I hail from, from the army background, so I know that physical fitness is the top one. Most, most priority if you want to live a good life without using sticks in your old age.
0:16:40 Haha. You want to stay on your, on your, obviously on your feet. So yeah. So this, this is the basic motivation.
0:16:49 I want to stay young and I want to stay healthy. So that's my Uh, You know, when you cross 30, you feel like that.
0:17:09 If you do not work out, and, uh, then, obviously, you feel, uh, a little bit low, and more brain fog, so, uh, it, like, aging has impact on your, uh, on your life, so, to counter that, it's also my motivation now, it's a part of my motivation also that.
0:17:30 To keep my energy levels good, and to avoid PCOs, and stay healthy, and stay young, so, these are my motivations and they are still the same.
0:17:41 I see, yeah. Um, have there ever been times that you may have skipped a workout or failed to follow the routine?
0:17:51 Anything like that? Yeah, it, it happens sometimes when you feel lazy and you feel like, no, I don't want to go for a workout today, I might.
0:18:02 want to watch something, or I want to go out with the family. So I do that. Yes. I see. And in these types of scenarios, what helps you push back and get back in the gym?
0:18:18 No, actually, if, uh, uhm, like, I am satisfied with my workout routine for the entire week that I, okay, I have worked out four days a week and I have trained my muscles and all muscles, like, I have trained.
0:18:34 And trained all my muscles, then, then I can go for, okay, I don't feel like going out for a gym or a workout.
0:18:41 That's fine. But if, like, I have my legs left to be trained for this week, then I would like, no, I have to go.
0:18:49 So that's the. I use for getting back to the workout. I see. Um, which one? One would you say is a bigger motivator?
0:19:02 The visible thing you see in yourself? Or the would it be maybe feedback or compliments from others that fuels your motivation?
0:19:14 I think it's both equally important. Uh, if you see the result, then you get motivated and the other people. They compliment you, that you changed a lot, and that also motivates you.
0:19:28 So, I cannot say that it's one of them. I see. I see. Speaking of the hypothetical app again, do you think videos where you may have skipped a workout or maybe you might be feeling a little nervous?
0:19:46 Do you think reminders or nudges like, oh, at least try to get a 15-minute walk-in or try to do this, try to do that.
0:19:56 Do you think these kind of notifications are helpful or annoying? Uh. Actually, uh, I have, like, uh, I don't think so it's helpful, because, uhm.
0:20:10 Uh, if you don't feel like going out and, uh, your application is reminding you, okay, go for a 15 minutes walk and all that.
0:20:19 But you, uh, let's say you ignore them also. Then after a certain time, like after one hour. Maybe those notifications make you feel guilty.
0:20:31 And you feel awkward and it turns your mood a little bit bad. So then it might be a hazard for an application and the user might not use that.
0:20:43 So, yes, if like one or two reminders, that's fine. But if. For like more than one and two reminders and notification, then for me, it will be offending.
0:20:57 I wouldn't, like, come on. I know I have to work out, but just don't remind me again and again. It's my choice.
0:21:05 I see. Yeah. And have you ever set any specific fitness goals? Like, it could be a goal weight, maybe strength, kind of consistency, a PR, or even just to get better.
0:21:19 Anything like that? Uh, I usually try to be consistent. And, uh, I, I never, uh, set a goals in terms of inches.
0:21:33 But yes, I, sometimes if I feel like I'm overweight, then I try to reduce my weight. So I try to keep my weight in a healthy range.
0:21:43 So weight is always my target, that's it. I see. Uuuh, do you have any physical limitations or injuries?
0:21:55 Or health conditions that might prevent you from getting a proper workout in? No, no. I see. Uhm, would you be comfortable sharing your medical data like, maybe your blood reports or stuff like that with this hypothetical app if it promised you better recommendations?
0:22:19 Like, say, if you have a lack of a certain vitamin or a deficiency, it may suggest you for it. that could naturally help boost that or overcome that deficiency.
0:22:32 Do you think something like that would be? Something you would be interested in? Yeah, I would be interested in in getting these type of suggestions.
0:22:43 But sharing the personal medical reports is kind of, like, I will not be okay with that. But, yeah, if you ask me.
0:22:51 Ask me about how I'm feeling, and generally, uhm, ask me about the level, like, the vitamin D level. And don't, like, not to upload all my blood reports, like, in a PDF form, but yeah.
0:23:07 But a little bit of data, like, uh, what was your recent vitamin D level, what was your thyroid level, and wha- what was your pH in last, uh, Black City, so that I can enter, but I will not be able be comfortable with entering all my medical reports into an application knowing that might hurt my privacy
0:23:31 . Because anything in the, in the air is accessible to anybody. So yeah, keeping that in mind, keeping that in mind, I will not be comfortable.
0:23:39 in sharing my medical reports. Yes, I can add a little bit generalized, uh, levels of my important, significant information. I can, uh, my, like, vitamins level.
0:23:52 I can do that, and on basis of that, if. Uh, application suggesting me some foods and some multivitamins or, uhm, any pre-workout, post-workout.
0:24:04 So, that's okay with me. Hmm, I see. Uh, if the application assured you. You in some way that your data was not being misused or mishandled.
0:24:17 Do you think that would help change your opinion? No, I have not changed my opinion. I see. And would you like the option to be able to decide?
0:24:28 Medical inputs that you're putting in, like I know you mentioned, you would be okay with putting in only specific things.
0:24:36 So. So, do you think having the option would be a better way to go about it? Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes.
0:24:46 I see. And are you following any diet or nutrition plan right now? It doesn't have to be fully structured, but even loosely.
0:24:57 Uh, I. I am following gluten-free diet for the past five years, and, uh, yes, past five years. Uh, I only eat gluten when I do not have any other option, but I prefer not to.
0:25:15 I see. Uh, do you talk to a nutritionist or a dietitian, maybe a trainer, to come up with this? Sorry, I cannot hear you.
0:25:27 What you said? Uhm, I was asking if you worked with a, nutritionist or a dietitian, or maybe even a trainer, to help come up with this plan?
0:25:39 Have I ever worked with or if I can work or if I want to work? Uhm, first question would be if you've ever worked with one?
0:25:50 No, I never worked with any. Hm, but would you want to? Hm, if in future I, uh, feel like then I might, I might go for it.
0:26:04 I see. And could you tell me a little more about your diet? Like, do you follow it? Super? Or strictly, do you just try to sometimes avoid gluten or, like, I know you mentioned you don't prefer eating it.
0:26:23 Any other restrictions that you've added in your plan? Uhm. I do not have any other specific restrictions, uh, but it's like, I don't like to eat a lot of it.
0:26:36 I a lot of junk food. I don't prefer. Like, it irritates me. Actually, it irritates me. So, I do not go for junk food.
0:26:45 Much, like, once or twice a month, that's fine for me. And, uh, I try to have, more of a clean diet, based off, uh, vegetables and fruits.
0:26:58 And, uh, uuuh, hmmm. No other oil except, uh, olive oil and, uh, butter, I think. I prefer that.
0:27:10 I do not go for canola and other type of, uh, cooking oil. And, uh, I do not eat gluten. And, uh, yeah, if I really feel like, pray that I have some, uh, gravy, I cooked some, like, gravy, which it's very good in taste, and I want to have gluten with that, like some paratha or something.
0:27:33 Then I can eat gluten, but otherwise I do not eat gluten. That's the only description I have. Mhm. I You actively try to eat better, in general, rather than following a super-structured plan?
0:27:55 Yeah, I- actually try to eat better and healthy. I do not follow proper structured diet. As I mentioned, I do not- I do like to eat sweet things.
0:28:08 I do not like to eat junk food because I have observed that if you eat junk food, that it actually impacts your energy levels and your mood and your health overall.
0:28:19 You do not feel very active. When you are actually going out every day for hoteling and for junk food, then you are not that active in doing that.
0:28:29 So, when I actually personally felt that and experienced it, then I decided, oh my god, no, no, no junk food.
0:28:37 Not more junk food. And, uh, uh, I do not follow structured. I actually actively following and try to eat healthy from past five years.
0:28:53 I see. And would you say your diet affects your workout or your workout affects your diet? Actually, my diet affects my workout.
0:29:07 Would you collaborate? Uh, like, if you are going for heavy, uhm, weight training, then you are not taking the proper protein, then definitely you will feel more fatigued.
0:29:22 So, if you are not eating, uhm, proper fiber and, uh, then obviously you will feel, uh, more bloated and you, you will not be able to.
0:29:33 to lift good weights. So definitely your diet, uh, it has, like, if you are working out more, and you are not eating enough, you are not eating enough protein and fiber.
0:29:48 These both are important. Let's see. Yes, I don't consider much, but if you are not eating proper fiber, if you are not eating proper protein and you are actually working out.
0:29:58 more than you are exhausting yourself, so you need to know that. So if you want to, uh, so what I do, I.
0:30:06 I do rigorous weight training and I also eat healthy, like I try to follow my protein. intake and my water intake also.
0:30:17 So yes, your diet, in fact, your, uuuh, weight loss routine. Yes. Like you will not be able, you will not, you will not be able to catch up after one, two weeks.
0:30:28 If you are not eating properly, you're not. If you not eating proper enough protein, then you will not be that motivated as you were on the day one because you will get less energy.
0:30:38 And lethargic day by day, day by day, day by And after like two weeks, you will, you will like give up.
0:30:44 No, I cannot. So yes, having good, proper diet actually is a part of your, uh, indirectly, it is a motivation.
0:30:54 It actually is. It actually helps you with the consistency. People, sometimes people see it, sometimes people cannot see it, but it is there.
0:31:02 I see. And, do you use any supplements, like multivitamins? Or whey protein, creatine, anything like that? Uh, uhm, uh, I actually use some supplements.
0:31:18 Uh, supplement, uh, no, multivitamins, not the supplements, not the pre-workout or post-workout or anything like any, uh, what you, what you have just mentioned, I do not use them, but yes, I, I go for, I multivitamins, and sometimes I eat, uh, ginseng, ashwagandha, these type of things, and, and the
0:31:41 organic one. I prefer organic one, yes. So, you don't use protein as a supplement? But you try to incorporate it naturally in your diet.
0:31:54 Would you say that? I ha- yeah, I do not go for protein supplements. I never did. I prefer to have, like, egg whites and boiled chicken and grilled chicken and caper to in my, in my fridge and try to have it with my every meal possible.
0:32:12 So, I do not go for protein supplements. I see. No. Do you face any challenges while trying to eat better?
0:32:24 Could be time that maybe you don't have the time to cook stuff. Maybe motivation, cravings. Social settings, anything like that?
0:32:34 Yeah, uh, I actually paste the social settings. Sometimes, uh, sometimes, if I was, when I was, were doing chalk, then it wouldn't work.
0:32:47 It was very difficult for me, initially, to eat healthy during the daytime. So, you know what, I actually learned that, and tried to incorporate this over the five years of span, five years of span, that initially I have social, uhm, structure and, and my work routine, it was all kind of a hurdle for
0:33:11 me. It is, it's my journey, you can say. Initially I was not able to eat healthy due to during daytime, then what I tried to, uh, try to bring when, back then, then I started to take my lunch.
0:33:27 with me, take my lunchbox with me, then, uh, then sometimes, like, in, in conferences and meetings. You have no other option.
0:33:36 You have to eat whatever they are giving it to you. So, that was also a problem. Now, then, after that, I have, uh, made a list that which things I won't eat.
0:33:51 want to eat daily, and I try to prepare those meals and those foods, like sautéed vegetables. I want to eat every day.
0:34:01 So, I prepare sautéed vegetables, grilled chicken, and these type of things, like. Uhm, beef broth. So, these type of things, I try to prepare them on weekend.
0:34:15 And so. So that, whenever I feel like and I have time to eat, I eat. In spite of, uuuh, the timing or.
0:34:23 Or the meal preference. Hmm. I see. And, uhm, coming back. Back to this hypothetical app that we were talking about.
0:34:34 Uh, if it gave you context aware suggestions. Like, say there's, uh, the month of Ramzan or Ramadan.
0:34:46 You're fasting. Would you? Prefer options that cater to your routine during that time, or maybe even cuisine preferences. Like, say, say, if you like home-cooked food more, it'll give you more suggestions like that.
0:35:00 Say, if you like another cuisine, it gives you suggestions like that. Do you see something that's something that could be useful?
0:35:06 Uhm, it can be useful, uhm, like, like, if, uh, it's like, Ramadan and you want to eat, uh, home-cooked and, uhm, the app is giving you suggestions.
0:35:21 I think it's, uh, it's more ahead of an advanced stage for that specific hypothetical app. So you can, if you want to incorporate that, then you can incorporate that in stage 2, let's say.
0:35:36 Stage 3 of the development of that app, if it worked at stage 1. So if you want, if you have, uh, this.
0:35:43 This idea, it can be good, but for me, it's too early to comment. I am not looking forward for any app.
0:35:52 You have to give me suggestions on a specific Ramadan month or a time in Bixi because it's just right now.
0:36:00 one month in a whole year. So I don't think so I'll be looking for this type of application at my first, uh, stage, no.
0:36:13 And do you think, AI-based suggestions would be something that you would be interested in? Like, would you be able to trust them?
0:36:24 Uh, like, you're asking the wrong person this question. If you want to, if you want to trust AI, uhm, if you, you want to, like, you want to ask that this app, this hypothetical app would be AI-enabled, uhm, Okay, I should say, uh, some people they are okay with AI in English.
0:36:56 And some people are not. You know, there are two categories of people. So, I have, I am one of the people who are not comfortable with AI-enabled app.
0:37:10 Hmm. I see. Okay. So, uh, if it's, uh, it's like, uh, the app is running on the other algorithm, then it's fine with me.
0:37:20 Is there something specific why you don't, uh, prefer an AI enabled app? Is it the fact that you are not able to maybe trust them or maybe you prefer a human touch?
0:37:36 Yeah, I do not trust AI. Yeah, why would I, like, why would I let AI to manage my diet and my whole routine?
0:37:52 Like, I can't. I cannot do it myself. I don't want to be, be a robot and being monitored by AI.
0:38:00 And being run by AI. Okay. I don't want to follow AI. I see. I see. Yeah. And, uhm, coming to the topic of apps.
0:38:17 Have you ever used, like, I know you mentioned that you use an app to work out at home, right? Something stretch.
0:38:24 Yeah, just stretch. Yes, uh, have you ever tried any other apps as well? As per the workout is considered, no, I did not.
0:38:39 Any other apps for maybe tracking your workouts when you used to go to the gym or something that tracks maybe your diet, anything like that?
0:38:51 Any other fitness apps? No, I did not. I, I've, uuuh, actually used app. Just one, one app, I told you, and I use app for tracking my periods and that's it.
0:39:03 Mhm. I see. Uh, any reason why you were drawn to choose Just Stretch as the app that you wanted to go with?
0:39:12 Because. Yes, at that time, I, I felt that my body is getting stiffed. So, then I looked at because I always work out and I never paid attention.
0:39:29 my muscles. So with the, with over the time I've felt a little bit stiffness in my body. So initially, like in this year, I, I actually decided that I will give time.
0:39:45 To, uh, stretching also, I will give it a reference that it's, it's actually a good. Good thing to, uh, stretch and relax your muscles, uhm, after, like, heavy workout.
0:40:01 That's why I opted for just stretch because I, as I mentioned earlier that, as a beginner, I did not know how what kind of stretching I should do for particular muscles.
0:40:13 At that, in this category, I had zero knowledge. So that's why I, I went for an app to guide me.
0:40:23 I see. Yeah. And how long have you been using this app for? Uhm, 3-4 months. I see.
0:40:35 And how would you say the experience has been so far? It's good. Because I did not know how to stretch the neck muscles and upper, upper back.
0:40:48 So it's good. I see. And how often would you say you use the app? Uhm, like, uh, it's like four, five times?
0:41:06 Five times in a, in a, in a week, yes. Five times. I see. Uhm. And how do you engage with it?
0:41:16 Like, I know you mentioned you like to watch videos on the phone. So is it. The same for this app as well?
0:41:24 Yes, yes, on my phone. I see. Like, I, like, like, I want to. Like, they have, like, these type of categories, like, wake up routine, and, uhm, go to bed types of routine.
0:41:36 So, if I want to. If want to go for wake up routine, so I open it, and I play the tutorial, and keep my phone in front of me, and.
0:41:46 And follow whatever they, they want me to do, and they are doing in, in, in the video, so I follow them.
0:41:54 Nice. And how long do these videos usually 7 minutes, 8 minutes, uhm, and sometimes 12 minutes.
0:42:08 I see. And do you think these shorter videos are more easier to follow, like less of a commitment in the morning or especially in when you're going to sleep?
0:42:20 Yes. Yes. Yes. Shorter videos are also easier. It's better than the longer one because, uh, uh, see, uh, when you are weak, uh, if you have fast morning.
0:42:34 And you do not have slow morning, so you cannot, uuuh, uuuh, find time to find time, free time, more than 10 minutes to stretch your body, full body.
0:42:46 So I would prefer that I have to go for. Work, then I can only give five to seven minutes in the morning, uh, right after waking up to actually have a full body stretch.
0:42:58 So, five, the video timing between five to ten, ten minutes is, is the best. Seven hours. I, I personally say seven to eight minutes videos are good, good enough.
0:43:10 Hmm. I see. So, you would. Would you say you don't prefer, like, those 30-minute videos where you just put it on and then you have to, you know, work out with the person?
0:43:22 People do that, but maybe in a later age, I'll prefer that, but not right now.
0:43:33 I cannot, actually, I cannot see 30 minutes long videos. For the training, I prefer to see something else after like 10 minutes.
0:43:46 So, I cannot, I cannot be that much focused on one single thing for 30 minutes, sorry. Yeah, I cannot. Do you use any devices or wearables, like a smartwatch, maybe a smartphone?
0:44:02 I, I prefer smartwatch. I wear it sometimes. So, do you mind telling me what smartwatch it is?
0:44:17 Uh. It was Redmi, but now I'm not using it, like from 5-6 months I'm not using it. not using smartwatch, but it was Redmi.
0:44:33 I see. Uh, any reason? Reason you stopped using them? Actually, I lost it. After that, my husband won't let me use his, uh, I think that's Samson's, but I'm like, no, I'm okay without it for a moment.
0:44:50 Maybe. After, like, one, two months, maybe it's, like, not a hard and fast role. I see. Yeah. When you had a smartwatch, what were the kind of things that you were tracking with it?
0:45:06 Heart rate. And, and yeah, heart rate and blood, blood levels. That's it. So the. Those were the only two things you liked tracking.
0:45:18 Yes. Uh, were you also ever interested in tracking? Other metrics, like maybe steps or your sleep count, you know, sleep quality, anything like that?
0:45:31 Uh, I was interested once in tracking my sleep, sleep, but actually that scared me. So I prefer not to. So as I know I'm okay whatever the way I'm sleeping, or I, I don't want to track that.
0:45:47 So, I, I was okay with okay, I'm having like from past two months, I'm having hours sleep time, seven hours.
0:45:55 Seven hours or eight hours. I just, I, I was just restricted to that because when you get into so much into some stuff.
0:46:03 It gets on your nerves sometimes. Yeah. So I prefer to keep a journal check. Like, on your things, but not get into the details.
0:46:17 I see. So just like, an order. Yeah. Yeah, because if, you know, if you are having a hectic routine. And let's say from past two, three months, you are not able to sleep properly.
0:46:31 Or from past five, five to six days, you are having. Sleep less than six hours. Then a soft reminder is enough that, oh my god, from past five, six days.
0:46:43 I am having less sleep, so I need to sleep more on weekend, or I need to, uh, you know, uhm, relax.
0:46:51 Recover. Recover and keep a check on my sleep cycle or sleep routine. So that's the, that's. Good enough, not more than that, because nowadays people are so busy.
0:47:03 You cannot keep it, keep an eye on everything. Yeah, I see. Have you ever stopped using an app like that, if ever?
0:47:24 Uh, like, if you've ever had a fitness app, or like a step-tracking app, or something like that before, have you ever stopped?
0:47:31 Stopped using one, because of a reason. Like, eh, you felt it wasn't accurate, anything like that? Uh, I do not remember anything at the moment, that I actually, actively using any of any app and then I stopped using it because it was not good or it did not serve my purpose.
0:47:56 So I don't remember that, so I'm sorry, I cannot help you with this. OK, so more. Moving a little further, if I told you the name BioTrain, that would be BioTrain.
0:48:12 B-I-O-T-R-A-I-N. What is the first thing that comes to your mind? All right. Sorry, come again. If you, if I told you the name Biotrain, that would be B-I-O-T-R-A R-A-I-N.
0:48:30 Okay. What do you think, like, what is the first thing that comes to your mind? A biotrain. Uh, literally, I am, I am, I cannot, uh, it's like, I feel like something related to biology.
0:48:52 Biotrain or, uh, yeah, not about the fitness. Fitness not, is not, is not incoming for me. I see. And when you think of an app called Biotrain, what kind of features are there?
0:49:08 Like, it's more aligned towards the, uhm, uhm, scientific, uh, health measures, you know? Hmm. Scientifically, uhm, uh, organized, uh, health measures, which are more, more inclined towards the, uh, medical side.
0:49:32 I feel like it's more inclined towards the medicines and the medical side rather than the fitness side. So I think, uh.
0:49:40 This, this came in my I see. And what kind of a feeling does that? Like, does it feel irrelevant? Does it feel too generic?
0:49:55 Does it feel, too different? Like, what are your thoughts on it? If you had to use maybe one adjective to describe it, how would you describe it?
0:50:04 Irrelevant. I see. And do you think there's room for improvement? For the name? Yes, definitely. Because, uh, this name does not.
0:50:20 As per my opinion, whatever hypothetical scenarios you have discussed with me and, uh, got my feedback on. Keeping all the attributes or traits for that hypothetical application, this name does not suit well.
0:50:37 You need to come up with the good names. Mhm. I see. And, when it comes to, like, I remember you said something about, uh, like, if after a workout, if you feel sore or something.
0:50:53 You go for a massage or a sauna. Recovery tips. Do you think recovery tips would be something? You would be interested in receiving from an, uh, like from a hypothetical app?
0:51:07 Definitely, definitely. Recovering, uhm, uhm, you know, uh, in a fitness field, people are not aware that recovery matters the most.
0:51:17 If you want to achieve your goals, fitness goals, so recovery is, should be, should be one of your top most priorities.
0:51:26 As the, the more, like people actually focus on your, somehow people focus on work. Workout, people focus on, uhm, diet, but they do not focus on recovery, because they, and then eventually they are.
0:51:41 After two, three months, they are like, oh, I'm not getting, oh, I'm not getting results, oh, I'm not getting results, because they do not focus on muscle recovery.
0:51:49 So, muscle recovery is as important as the training of the muscle. So, yes, I would definitely love to receive, uhm, uh, notifications or suggestions, uh, for my muscle recovery.
0:52:03 Yes. I see. Uhm, what do you feel about teachers, like, having a streak or achievement badges or maybe even leaderboards?
0:52:13 Where you could share your progress with your friends, other members of the community, anything like that, that might sound interesting.
0:52:21 Actually, I'm not from Gen Z, if I would definitely actually like to have this streak or I'm from Malaysia. You know, so this does not, uh, work for me.
0:52:33 I, uh, my internal satisfaction and the compliment from the people. and what I see change in my body, that these are the good measures for satisfaction level for me.
0:52:45 The streak and notifications and the bonus thing is, I, I'm sorry, this is not of any attraction. I see, and do you feel like leaderboards might be demotivating or actually.
0:53:01 See, if you have, like, a group of, uuh, 4-5 people, who are actually following that application, and they are serious about these leaderboards and things, and they are only for the sake of fun, then, okay, fine, but, uh, no comments, I cannot give my opinion.
0:53:25 I feedback on this thing, I'm sorry. Yeah. Really, you would not be interested in it? I'm not, I'm not. So I cannot say, I don't know what to say, so it's, you're asking the wrong person.
0:53:41 I see. And, do you feel like, instead of those kind of elements, if you were shown something like, oh, this was you last month, and you've gained a bit more stamina.
0:53:58 Or maybe you worked out more this month, basically comparing your progress with a previous version of yourself. Um, so, yeah, do you think that might be much more helpful or interesting?
0:54:09 Yes, yes, yeah, yes, Just, definitely. This will be more helpful that if they tell me that I had this type of stamina and I was working like two, let's say, was I was working like two hours a week and this year I'm working like four hours a week.
0:54:29 So this comparison. Hasn't worked wonderfully. Mm hmm. I see. Yeah. Yes, this would be more helpful. You would say? Yes, it is.
0:54:42 I see. And have you ever paid for a fitness? App, or service, or subscription, anything like that before? Yeah, yeah, about, for this, just stretch, yeah.
0:54:54 Uh, would you mind telling what the price range was, or what kind of a subscription was? Uh, it was, uh, an early, uh, subscription of like, I think, uh, $9,000.
0:55:10 Pakistani Rupees, or, uh, yeah. Yeah, see, see, uh, if, if you're asking, uh, okay, let me get it in a way.
0:55:22 If you're asking about the price range, then for a fitness app, I'll be okay if the, if the price range is from, uhm, like, uh, annual, ehm, it's like, you can say 70,000.
0:55:42 100, or 150 dollars, it's fine for me, yeah, yes. And you would prefer the annual plan? Ah, yeah, I always prefer annual plan.
0:55:58 I go for annual plan. Like, whenever I go for subscriptions, I all, I have subscriptions of some applications. And I always go for, uh.
0:56:06 Annual subscription. Yeah, not monthly. Sorry. Any particular. Uh, say, uh, uh, like, if I, First thing was that I'm clear, I'm very, I'm very much clear about this fact that I want to use this.
0:56:30 App or I want to incorporate this app in my life. So I look for the best suitable app. For myself regarding that perspective, and I try to buy the annual subscription because I know that I'm getting paid.
0:56:46 I'm going to use it for, for the first some quite significant period of my time. So yeah, I always go for annual.
0:56:54 Because I if I'm not sure I do not go for subscription if I'm sure and I like and I see.
0:57:02 And I read the review then I'm sure then I buy it for annual subscription. I see. And would you prefer, like, when you're paying for an application, would you prefer that they also have a free trial or?
0:57:19 Like, how do you feel about that, the free trial talk? Yes, I prefer free trial because in free trial I get paid.
0:57:27 And get to know that, okay, this is actually serving my purpose, so I have to buy it or I do not have to buy That, actually, that totally depends on the pre-trial.
0:57:37 So, yeah, pre-trial is a good thing. If you really want to have a serious buyer, then pre-trial pre-trial works. But, if you want that, the, the, the, the, the, the, the customer, he just downloaded the app, and for using the app, he has to buy it first, then, then you will definitely going to have to
0:57:59 drop your user percentage. So, free trial will always work. Better to stretch your user bandwidth.
0:58:14 I see. Do you have an opinion on whether they should be, like, specifically speaking for this hypothetical app? It would be related to fitness, it would take into account your routine, your workout schedule, your diet, the kind of- of preferences you have, and probably give you tailored plans according
0:58:36 to that. Do you think this kind of an app- What would be the optimum trial period range? Like, would it be 7 days, 14 days, maybe more?
0:58:47 I think 2 weeks. 2 weeks? 2 weeks, yeah. 2 weeks, because, uh, You cannot tell about a plan if, if, whether it's working for you or not, if you're not sure.
0:59:03 You're not actively, or actively following it for at least two weeks. Fourth night, you know, after 15 days. After 15 days, you are able to see, okay, yes, that suits me, or it does not suit me.
0:59:18 So, yes, two weeks. Two weeks. Fourteen days. I see. And would you say you like a more long or social workout experience, or would you say you like a more private, self-paced experience?
0:59:35 Both are equally important. I would say if, Both are equally important for me.
0:59:47 I cannot just say that I want to have a private, Personal workout sessions. Social also helps you to have a healthy lifestyle.
1:00:00 I think social life, you know. Both. So do you think social features, like, maybe having a community? In the app, something like that?
1:00:10 Do you think that would be helpful? Yes, definitely. Yes, yes. I see. And do you think having a live coach, or maybe virtual support, that would probably, be there to answer any queries at any time?
1:00:27 Do you think something like that would also be helpful? Very helpful. I see. And, how would you say that the, people around you affect your motivation?
1:00:43 Like, would you say it's positive? Would you say it's negative? People around, Motivation to work out? Uhm, I see the people around me.
1:01:04 I, actually, their opinion does not have any impact on me, to be very honest, but yes. Uh, the people around me, and yes, we all are, uh, physically active people.
1:01:20 And we prefer to be healthy, in a, in a good shape, yes. I see. I see. Yeah. Uhm, I think I'm almost at the end of my questions.
1:01:34 So, anything. Anything that you think we may not have covered or that something we may not have asked or mentioned, anything that we missed.
1:01:44 You can feel, you know, feel free to mention it right now or even later if you want to reach out to us.
1:01:52 Thank you, Eric. For me, for instance, if I say that it's the average, it's a different. I have ever given to somebody.
1:02:04 So you have, uh, you have left no, uh. Topic uncovered. Every facet is covered by your feedback, I must say.
1:02:15 Very consolidated and thoroughly, uh, designed feedback. Yeah. Thank you. Uhm, so I think that's it from me. Thank you so much for your time.
1:02:27 This was really, really helpful and insightful and we hope that your. Feedback will help us shape the next phase of bio train.
1:02:38 So, thank you for joining us today. Have a great day. Bye-bye. Thank you.
