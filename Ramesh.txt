02:50 And how long have you been going to the gym before? What? It's been 2 years. I mean, I'm doing some of the longer time, but then properly going for the gym and weight lifting and boxing.
03:02 I'm doing it in the last 2 years. Before that, I was doing exercises only at home, like, uh, in lockdown.
03:10 I'm done. We, obviously, we don't have access to gym, so I didn't normal exercise in home. And. And we'll see it's been two years since properly going gym.
03:23 Uhh, if you don't mind me asking, what was your motive? I'm David. Like, what might you start working on? Initially, it was like a- the ehm, you know, improve the self-confidence, you know.
03:39 There is a time when, you know, everyone goes to- the bad face of his life. So, and in that time, it's helped me.
03:47 Right now also. I will- every day I go gym only, I feel like if- if I won't go gym, I will not able to survive in the- I feel like that.
04:00 Mm-hmm. When it was here, uhh, no family, no connection, no face. So that's it. You know, spend time. So most of the time, after working, I, I just enjoy the gym.
04:12 So it, it helps me to- you know, feel like I'm doing something. Very. Would you call, as a hobby almost?
04:23 Yeah, it's a hobby. It's like a daily part of it. It's become a part of life. Mm, I see. And so you said you used to work out at home to correct?
04:36 Yeah. Amen. What, uhh, like, how would you usually decide what kind of workout you wanted to do? Like, would you see videos?
04:45 Would you see tutorials? Would you refer to your friends? Initially, initially of, uhh, I saw some videos in the YouTube and then- I, you know, I mark as an I, what to do daily.
04:59 For example, by said, in by said, what I can do. Six. Seven, you know, exercises. I fix it and I do continuously, uh, daily.
05:08 Like, one day for by say, one day for change. But, initially I start some videos and I fix 7, 6, 7 exercises.
05:15 And, same exercises I do, like, weekly ones. Let's begin . Yeah, I see. In other chest, then, actually, there's something, there's something, something, something, like that.
05:25 Mm-hmm. What do you, So, six days a week in the lockdown as well. Yeah, yeah, in lockdown, almost every day.
05:34 Why? Because I, I'm not using uhh, dumbbells weight. I'm just doing the freestyle, so I usually do every day. Every possibility.
05:44 Mm hmm. Yeah. I see. And what were some of the- challenges you had while you were working out at home?
05:54 Was it finding the space to work out the correct tool? I'm going go. Or maybe the motivation? No. For me, uhh, only the equipment.
06:08 Umm. Motivation was there, space was there, time was there, everything was there but the- only the equipment. The equipment was not available, so I just did the free style of it.
06:22 Thank you. I see. And coming back to the current scenario. You Do you like working out alone with friends or with a community or a trainer?
06:38 No, I don't. 7. Is that Jim? I don't know. I see. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What motivates you to be consistent every single day for six days of the week?
06:58 As I said, it's- it's drive me to go through my daily- . . . You know, like, otherwise I feel like I'm useless, uhh.
07:08 I feel working, uhh, in this- it improves my discipline. Like, most of the time, if I don't go, I feel guilty.
07:16 Like, something missing out today. I see. It's, it's become like a FOMO. Like, if I won't, even one day I take rest on Sunday, that day also I feel like.
07:28 Guilty, I should go to day also. So, sometimes in that guilty I don't take rest and. and I go to this way.
07:38 Mm-hmm. Uh, only it's, I feel like. Like that, it's only to survive in the body. Mm-hmm. The second thing is the discipline.
07:50 plane. Yeah, uh, being discipline is built confidence. Like, I can do anything. Thank you. Yeah, these are the things. And what do you say?
08:07 You say that interactive videos or tutorials helped you when we were starting to work up? Yeah, yeah, of course. Not because.
08:15 Because uhh, you know, everybody can't uhh, uhh, uhh, offer to get a train up. I'm back. So, definitely, video helps.
08:26 Right now, even though it is now even also, not regularly, but sometimes, you know, uhh. Something is not going properly, like, I'm doing bicep, but it's not properly building.
08:37 So, I look for the videos, what I'm doing, and. What should I change? So, it helps a lot. I see.
08:47 Uhh. And do you still track your health in other ways, like steps, calories or something? Yes. Yes. Yeah. Could you tell me a little more about that?
09:01 Uh, of course the mobile has the apps. Thanks. Health apps, uhh, that tracks mistakes calories also. And save time while doing gym.
09:11 in. Uhh, you know, uhh, while doing cycling or running. Every cardio machines have a, you know, how much we are running at what speed we are running.
09:20 How many calories you are burning. So, I will check on that and would be the apps I have. That helps me to practicalize.
09:28 Calaries and uh, steps. I see. Thank you. And how do you use this information in your daily life? So when you're tracking, uh, your steps and stuff?
09:44 How do you use it? And, until it is, I change my diet, like, some day if I'm- but learning less calories, then I will take my diet, little less.
09:56 I eat little less. I take little ensure like depends on the calories, how much I'm burning. If I'm burning more, then I'll take a little bit of stuff.
10:05 Hold on, uhh, whatever I need to manage. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's one mostly under the indict. It helps me to, You regulate my diet.
10:19 I see. And what made you an- interested in starting to track these things. Uhh. Initially, I was like, I needed to get a six-pack.
10:39 That's right. That is the one. The only main reason, then it became a habit. Now, I don't need a six-pack, but it's become a habit and, uhh, it helps me to like- what I'm doing, how much I'm waiting to make, uhh, to trap my fitness, like, uh, wait.
10:55 you fat and sugar. So. Thank you. Uhh, is that a real trap like your sleep maybe or something? I don't interact with my sleep, but.
11:12 Bye bye. But, uh, I try to, you know, uh, manage my sleep around 6 to 7 hours per day. Bye, see.
11:20 Yeah. Okay. Uh, are there any physical limitations or health conditions that affect you? During your workout? What? They did not know.
11:35 Nothing. Yeah. And, so when we're talking about a fitness app, would you be interested? address. or comfortable in sharing your medical information or reports with the app?
11:53 It depends on how what app helps me to do. Like, hmm, what it gives me back. Like, if my health reports, if I upload in my child's activity, then it gives me the whole detail.
12:07 Like, what should I even- It's, It regulates my diet also. It will change the diet. It will change my exercise, everything.
12:14 So, if something like that, any app can help me. And then it's not going to change. I see. So, if it was tailored and you knew what the benefits were.
12:25 Attached to it, it would be interesting to be interested in doing. Right. Right. I'll see. And how much would you be able to trust or follow AI based recommendation?
12:40 recommended. Right now you can say I uhh, 100, uhh, like 90, 90, 90. 1% I trust, by the girls. I mean, the only the charge equity, most of the time.
12:56 Thank and until then, . . not any other that's the charge equity I trust, like 99%. I see. Thank you. And coming back to your diet, uhh, you said you followed your diet, right?
13:12 Could you tell me a little more? You about what your diet looks like, what are your goals with the diet, something like that?
13:20 Uhh. You know, my diet is to only balance my weight and the fat, hmmm, and it. And give the proper protein how much I need it per day.

16:01 You Sometimes, like, uh, cream buns. I think. Yeah. Yeah. And have you ever worked with a nutritionist or a dietitian or- Oh it may be even a fitness app that helped you come on this diet?
16:22 No. No. Uh, so you- You made this diet on your own? Yeah, I made it. Oh, I see. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
16:41 You've been following it for? I'm following this from, like, last 6, 7. 1 months. I see. Do you ever switch up your diet, maybe with festival?
16:57 So, let's go. And, or something? No, no, no. It's the same that I follow every day. And, uh, it's been- You can say, like, it's been last two years.
17:08 I didn't change my weight. Not even a 2 kg or 3 kg. It's always fluctuating between 500 grams, 1 kg only.
17:18 Like, I almost managed the same weight. That's why I don't change my date. Better, if it's working. Yeah. Yeah. and And so do you meal prep or something?
17:33 Do you have someone who cooks for you? Or do you do the cooking on your own? No, I- Do you engage in meal prepping or would you rather make fresh food every single day?
17:46 Every single day I make fresh one. Hmm. I see. Yeah. And have you ever faced challenges while maintaining your diet?
17:58 Like I said, the weekend, that's a different thing. Any other- challenges? Challenge is, uhh, you know, night time after, you know, I go around 7 o- of the gym and come back with 9.9 at 8.
18:13 Then I need to take shower and then I need to cook myself. It goes like- 11.9 that I will take my dinner.
18:20 So that is the only main challenge for me. I will- I- I generally want- to yield before 9 I 8 I think, but it not possible for me to follow that time.
18:33 Is that it? Yeah, uhh, dinner is very late. I do. That is the only challenge right now I am facing.
18:42 enough. Otherwise remaining everything is like going perfect and routine as usual time. The only dinner challenge. No. No. I see.
18:55 And, uh, have you ever t- taken any health supplements or anything? Health supplement, in a sense, you're like a protein and- uhh, uhh, vitamins.
19:08 Both. Vitamin I take, uhh, omega t. And, uhh, supplement right now taking the protein last two months. It's been just two months.
19:21 and Oh, you have not used protein before that? Before, no. No. Only the milkshake is really a cell. . . . The only milkshake.
19:32 Right now, uhh, it's been 2 months, I'm just trying. Bye. I see. How has that been? I'm looking on for you?
19:48 I think, it is, uhh, what I can say that. you still, it's been two months, I'm taking that one, but no change in my weight.
20:01 So, I- I don't know, it's working a month, still and looking at it. Because I wanted to improve only two- I'm going do, for three cages.
20:12 Hm. Of my weight, I wanted to improve my weight. So, three cages, but that's where I take the, Uhh, protein, but it's not helping, I think.
20:21 But I'm still taking, hmmm. . . . No. And, uhm, any other features or- tools in any other apps that help you maintain your diet or consistency?
20:39 No. Mm. Okay. We're going to do the I see. And how important would you say is nutrition when compared to your fitness goals?
20:50 the It is important to, you know, to gain in every part. possible way, like, maintain your energy, to maintain your, you know, uh, daily time in the walk.
21:06 That we for you. So, uh, you're doing to build something, to, to shape something. So, to get that shape and maintain that.
21:14 You So, body or anything, you need to, uhh, nutrition. Otherwise, either you will get, if you don't follow the properly, then either you will.
21:23 . . And lose that shape, what you wanted, uhh, you will gain the weight. Mm hmm. So, to maintain the body and the physics, you need nutrition.
21:40 Definitely, otherwise, whatever you are doing every day, you how much time you spend in a gym, how much. Now, even you offer to get a trainer, it won't help you.
21:51 Die is the most important thing in any. evening. fitness training. Nice thing. Would you say it's as important as for your fitness goals or more?
22:06 . . Both are equally important. I see. Both are equally important. Both need to be managed. Of only otherwise, any imbalance between them, you won't achieve what you, why aim to.
22:19 Yeah. And let's move on to. Now, a little more about the fitness and wellness apps if you use any right now.
22:35 . . . So, do you use any fitness, maybe diet apps for tracking, anything like that? . . Hey, uh, no, the only app that I track for calories and, uh, the mistakes is the health app which gives you.
22:51 I feel provides the health app. There's the only app I'm using. I don't know any other apps. . . . . I see. Ok.
23:03 And- have you ever tried another app before? . . No. No? Ok. No. If you don't mind me asking, is there a reason why you ha- haven't tried any fitness app yet?
23:20 Because from the initially I was like- I mean, I never, I didn't feel that I needed any app to track my calories.
23:29 Why? Because I always lean and- and you know, almost like a switch. So, I never thought about it. I mean, I would have- No.
23:39 And, mainly my workout is to- Maintain what I have. Not to- Gain our degrees, any fat or anything.
23:53 So, I just- I just have- to maintain what my body has. So, I never felt like I need to track anything.
24:02 I just do my- Bye I look out and I feel like I'm okay. That's it. That's why I never followed in yet.
24:11 Mmm. So say if there was an app that helped you with your tracking, with planning your workout. Okay. So, I'm going out with remembering and tracking the workouts that you have done for the day.
24:25 Maybe it also gives you a little bit of a chance to go exercise. It also has a nutrition, diet, aspect to it.
24:32 Would something interest you? Bye bye. And downloading the app? Yeah, it is industry. If everything, you know, with new, new pressure.
24:43 I appreciate it. And to diet and everything it has in one app, then that definitely helps. Mm-hmm. You Uhh, any features or something that you would be willing to pay for on an app like that.
24:59 Have a good day. It could be maybe a customized ad plans. It could be maybe a tailored workout plan. Anything.
25:07 meeting. Like that that you wouldn't mind paying for. Yeah, yeah. Uh, Taylor workout plan with the diet. I doing. I see.
25:18 Yeah. So. I love it. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. No, I don't need some. Uhh, so like a complete approach, right? Like fitness plus diet?
25:29 Yes. Mmm. . . I see. And how much do you think would it be reasonable for the app to ch- add you for features like that?
25:42 If it truly helps you with your fitness roles and your diet? All right. Uh, amongst, uh, it depends on, you know, person to person, it varies.
25:56 I'll guys in the audience, somebody can offer, somebody cannot offer. So, I mean, app designer can design that very well.
26:04 So, you must have a data like people's ranges who are doing, you know, what kind of people are joining. Ready.
26:12 And how much they ready willing to spend the amount. So, I think it's better. better. Maybe you know that more than me.
26:23 But right now, for Jim, I am paying, like, in India. In rupees, you can say, like, 8,000 to 9,000 rupees.
26:32 Hmm. I see. I will mix it. Yeah. You're ready. Thank you. I can, like, if, no, no, no, it's a just for a month.
26:40 Hmm. I see. Yeah. Good. Sorry. Oh, you were saying something? Yeah, so, right now I'm paying that much. Okay. So, with gym, if I want to add the diet and nutrition, I can go, like, more than, uhh, uhh, more 6 to 7,000.
27:03 So, I want to spend on, uhh, like, with gym plus diet and- nutrition, everything I want to, and I combine, like, 15 to 20,000, I can manage.
27:14 But, it may be not, say- people are other persons also, right? Okay. Yeah. I see. Umm, would you prefer paying money?
27:24 and like you currently do maybe a one time fee or like an annual subscription kind of a basis. Which one?
27:32 And, And, And, Do you think what's so true the best? I think it's, like, annual or six months is better.
27:40 Thank you. Nicely. And good, flexible, rising, help you. Ooh. Motivate you to maybe sign up for it. If they offer a lot of options.
27:54 Options. Yes. Yeah. We'll see you in the next if I'm paying something and it gets extra benefit, then it's, it's good always.
28:03 Yeah. again. I think. And, so when you think about being- Being fit or about being healthy, what does it mean?
28:18 What does being fit look like for you? Thank you. Thank you. For being fit. From the inside, like, not only.
28:29 . In the show, I feel like the body and everything is like, what we built, it's just a show. Like, you, we need to.
28:37 That's it. But the actual fitness comes from the inside, like, my fitness, I. Bye. I measure my fitness with my speed.
28:49 Like how speed I am in response. response. Better. Uhh, for example, how, umm, my stamina. Mmm. Thank you. Like, while running or anything, how long I can run, how many kilometers I can run without.
29:09 Thank you stopping a pause. Uh, like, uh, ehm, once we'd like, let's say, uh, ehm, tell us. . How long you can run?
29:20 How many steps? Like, building steps? Like, floors, one by one, two floors. you How many floors you can walk without, you know, without stopping or without taking pause without, uhh.
29:33 . Uhh, you know, suffocating. So, these are the things that defines thickness. next. I see. Yes. How do you feel about the current level of your.
29:49 I'm to school. Your activity or your fitness or your overall health right now. and we're ready to end up. Uh, I'm good.
29:59 Mm-hmm. That's what I can say, I love people. I, even, along with. With the fitness, I regularly, I mean, every 3 months, I go for the blood checkup.
30:10 So, just last week, I did my blood checkup and, uhm. So, everything was fine. Even with a BP also, like a BP also, like 1.23 by 1D.
30:22 . . So, I think it's all goes, my fitness only. The sugar level. I that. And also was very perfect. And the fat and everything was very, very like whatever the level I needed.
30:37 There go. And that, that is the only I have. So, I think it's all goes to the fitness. I'm training every day and I'm managing my time.
30:45 That's why my health also, like, that's good. Thank you. I see. And, umm, coming back to the tracking that we were speaking about.
31:00 What? What? So, how do you have to do it manually? Or is it automatic? Or do you just- I know what you're doing already.
31:13 It's manually, not automatic. So, can you walk me through- So, how you track it manually? I mean, I didn't get taken- repaired to the question.
31:25 So, safe. If you don't know, for example, uhh, today you're doing three sets of a particular exercise. Do you note down?
31:32 What kind of weight? You use or how many reps you did? Anything like that? No, no, no. Uh, I usually, it's like, you can say, It's automated.
31:43 I know I've fixed six or seven exercises per day. Hm? And I can do that on- on your own. Until one or two months, continuously.
31:52 So, the same weight. I mean, every exercise, little bit, increase the weight. But the say, the- The same two three ways I do for a one or two months.
32:02 Then, I'll increase my weight. Great. I see. Yeah. So, would you say there's anything frustrating? history. Or, umm, tedious if you have to track, like, it could also be your diet, your workout, eh.
32:22 Is there anything, is there anything frustrating about the whole tracking process? is it? No, not that. I didn't feel it.
32:34 I just, for me, it's like a routine. It's a part of life, so you need to. Thank you. If you want to improve anything, you know, to track little bit, at least, not the, like, 100%.
32:44 At least you can track to. 60% for you can, you know, manage your, uh, fitness, your goal. Hmm. You I see.
32:56 And when you think of people who are fit in your perspective. What come? Like, are they maintaining a certain weight?
33:08 Do they have six packs? Or are they Is it, could be simple? Like, they're just doing some activity and following some diet.
33:16 What would you define as being fit? For me, like, for me, as I said, the speed. I, I believe in speed.
33:26 The speed and, uh, speed and, I, I believe, fitness. the main button. Because the fitness should be there. And the body and the suspectability, like, it should show up, like, it's, it's a decoration.
33:44 Yeah, when I see, uh, most of the people in my gym, uh, for me, fitness. Thank I'll see video. I mean, but for my perspective, who doing gym plus boxing?
33:58 Hmm. Mm hmm. That people are witnessed from, uhh, fit for me. And many women only doing, uhh, you know, a boxing, uhh, only doing the gym.
34:07 I feel like, okay, they're also good, but not fit as fit as fit who are doing boxing and uhh. I see.
34:18 I see. So, would you say fitness is about, enjoyment, structure, bringing balance to your life or being, the best version of yourself.
34:34 Yeah, and basic version of our self, plus enjoyment with, discipline. Hmm, I see. Yeah. And, Have there been times where you were not able to keep up with your routine or something?
34:52 Thank watching. I think while logged on. Okay. But after coming through by, uhh, uhh, adding to lady, like, any restriction or any associative thing, I manage but- What is this?
35:11 In lockdown I feel a little bit, but because, uhh, the world may be done because I don't have- job that time.
35:21 So, maybe that's the reason, but after coming to Dubai, I didn't- anything, frustrating or anything. I see. So, would you say being in a proper routine?
35:35 be in, helped you carve out more time for your gym? Yes, yes. That, that's the main thing. Being. One, and time, and being in discipline?
35:47 No. Or, whatever the, You If you go for the whatever the time you plan, then you will get the time to gym.
35:57 If you miss manage trying. Thanks. Then it's very difficult to be on time. For me, let's say, if I have to go.
36:07 What? I have to go. If it, if it is 7 type A, I want bougie. Alright. again. So, my body, you can say, my senses are work only the particular time only.
36:22 If I, if I have. I to go 7 o'clock then I need to be 7. If it is 7 that is.
36:28 Like, even I go, I don't do proper hmmm. Yeah. I see. So my name does it dates. Hmmm. Right. And would you say the, which one would you say like progress, looking at your progress of?
36:47 Oh or receiving feedback? Which one of them helps you be more consistent? stand. Progress only. Progress? So improving if you are doing good.
37:02 you It's natural way you motivate yourself. For that, you know, if you are progressing then. and you are doing good, then I think sometimes you won't need any feedback from other people.
37:18 So, you feel it. You know. You feel it. And it motivates, uhh, I mean, it motivates more, more than what other people say.
37:26 So other people, you know, just they can say, they, they don't mean it. They might be just, say like, oh, you are doing good, yo.
37:35 But, you yourself, you will feel, if you improve something good. Mm-hmm. We'll see now that we spoke about the whole timing thing and how, you know, you have to be in a room.
37:51 What do you mean for you to be able to work out efficiently? Would you say that if you received reminders?
37:59 please you through this Thank for watching. Like you said you go at 7. So maybe at 65. If you received reminders, do you think that would annoy?
38:07 Bye-bye. Do you or would that help you remember that, oh, it's time for me to go to the gym. Maybe I should get ready.
38:13 Do it. For me, uhh, it won't help that much, but I know my friends who need to remind us. Otherwise.
38:23 I love it. Even they don't drink even water also. But for me, it, you can say, it's annoying. Mmm. you Yeah.
38:35 I, I know, my brain knows, what am I need to go, even- I am sleeping, I just wake up. Hmm.
38:44 I see. But, but other people needs, I think, remainder is- We'll see in a lot of cases, notifications are the best for most of the people.
38:52 So. So, you . . I see. Uhh, so you mentioned you work out alone, right? Yeah. Has that. There you go. Has that always been the case?
39:06 Yes, yes. If I have, I do. Yeah. And, The main reason for it is, like, if I work out in a, like, friend or any, in a partner, it takes a lot of time.
39:22 I see. I need to wait for him also. Hmm. Why? Bye. If I, if I take love, you know, long the break or you can say, two, three minutes a break.
39:36 Okay. Take it off. My body response will go down, my body heat and the performance will go down. I don't wait.
39:44 safe. for a longer time. So, I just need, that's my main reason, uh, uh, work a little bit. We'll next week.
39:52 Hmm. Yeah. And same time, I need to manage 2-2 exercise. I remember that. . . . Just on back. Just, um. And, alright.
40:07 And, as I said,.. I do boxing also. So, I have a less time. So, that's why I need to go more quicker.
40:15 That's why I need to,. I don't join with partner. I see. So, routine is already pretty jump-packed. That's right. I will be able to stay.
40:26 I see. Right. And do you think, uhh. Umm, looking at other people's progress. Like, say, oh, your friend worked out for two hours today.
40:39 He did so and so. Like, say, he also had back in chest. He had these exercises. Do you think comparing that?
40:48 Oh. Or adding leaderboards or something to track progress? Do you think that would help you get more motivated? We'll see better or competitive?
40:58 Or do you think that is something that you would be really interested in? Oh. you not really, not really interested.
41:06 I never, I never, you know, I never compare with anyone. I'm not, I'm not saying this or thing but. you from the last two or three years, I, I know what I need to do.
41:18 I just do it. I never see other what. Alright. Other people are doing how much they include or not include.
41:24 I don't give that much effort to them. I just know. What I need to do when I do that. And only I see myself and include or not.
41:35 up. . . . . . . I gain answer. What I need is that target actually would or not. That only thing. I check other. . I don't see other people.
41:48 Correct. Yeah. So. Oh. Would you say that you prefer more of a private self-paced experience? and Yes, yes.
42:03 I'd be better. I see. And how would you say- You the people around you influence your motivation, like, to put you say it's causative?
42:15 Or would you say- Bye. It's a bit- No, it's positive word, uhm, it comes up perfectly. . So many people who are not interested in gym are never went to gym.
42:31 When they see me, they saw me. So- It's really nice. They joined in. I see. So I think it is positive.
42:40 Most of the people, it's so much- around them who are, you know, uhh, doing, who are interested in fitness. Most people join.
42:49 Bye bye. Or do some activities. Mainly not that much perfect or not rooting, they follow. But at least they join.
42:56 Wheatly or. Now ahead and Okay. Let's and check do this, they will do something. So, it's a positive change. Thank you.
43:04 Thank you. And do you think having virtual support or, life coaching or any of the features like that help you if say we were to add it to the hypothetical, Yes, it is itself.
43:25 It's a, no, I didn't took any, what. . It's all our, uhh, physical training. I'm in the live training. But I see, I don't know my, uhh, my training sign there, you know.
43:37 In general, most people follow the match. Some, uhh, some people, you know, offer to trainer. They do, they do it.
43:45 So, I think it's, it helps. I see. Okay. So. Bye. If, like, I'm towards the end of my questions, we will be wrapping up.
43:59 Uhh, I just had a f***ing phone. And we wrap this up. So if a fitness really got you, like, it understood your life, your schedule.
44:09 You your motivation, your routine. What should it do differently from the other. Do you think? Do you think? I think.
44:24 Yeah, yeah, I, I love to jump. I mean, it's, you know, it's include everything. Like, you have to direct the nutrition to, uh, tailoring exercise.
44:33 And anything, along with, I think, it may not be possible to have, but what, in my opinion, a lot of like, as I said, I go with every 3 months of blood and blood and sugar dish.
44:46 This kind of dish, in this app has, Okay. Okay. Then, it will help a lot of people. So, most of the people, they do, of course, they follow their new routine and everything, but- the initial.
44:59 It's like, what we follow is that, like, as I said, it's a body, from the upper side. . . . . . . but from the inner side, exactly, how much fat we have, how much sugar we have.
45:12 These are the very important things. So, if you include this one in half, I think, it will be great. So, when, when about the.
45:22 a blood glucose, would you say, like, when you're talking in context of the act, would you, are you referring to the fact that maybe if the.
45:30 Thank you. Have can take the reports, analyze them and give you feedback or tailor your plan according to those reports.
45:37 Do you think? That, that was, that one thing also, that one thing also, but same time you can not manage with clinic, you have a connection with.
45:46 If you don't have a clinic, uhh, you are, whoever the fellows are joining, you can, you know, tell them. So, that kind of thing.
46:00 Now, I- They go myself, but most of the people, they do exercise, they do everything. But, I don't think they, you know, they go- I you like for the sugar taste of everything.
46:12 Maybe they go maybe like once a year or they got some illness that time only, but not- I see. Umm, so before we wrap up- Is there anything else you would like to mention that maybe we didn't cover or we didn't ask that you would still like to- not mention this?
46:39 Alright, now there is nothing like in my mind. You just like, if I give, I, you know, I have an e-mail.
46:46 So I will text you an e-mail. Shortly, shortly. Good evening. So, thank you for your time, Ramesh. This was really helpful, and it will help.
