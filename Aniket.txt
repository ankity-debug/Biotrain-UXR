08:29 It's cool. It's like that. And after that, uhh, I think- I think, evening I just do a walk of 25 minutes, 25 to 20 minutes.
08:40 That's the physical activity I do in my daily life. I see. Umm, how long have you been following these, uhh, after the- What do you spell?
08:53 Uhh, for the past 6 to 7 months. Mm-hmm. Bye, sir. So. Umm, what made you start getting active? Umm. When I was uhh, when the COVID hit, when the first lockdown got hit, then I uhh.
09:15 . I got restless and I thought, uhh, my body is in work, uhh, that much active. I uhh, that- my body is not productive enough.
09:25 So, I thought to start with some physical activity, which will also help me to- which will also help my mind to keep active and keep focused, whatever I do.
09:38 So, When I joined the gym I felt key, uhm, consistent. I need to be consistent and, It, it felt kind of joy.
09:50 I felt joy. I enjoyed working out. I enjoyed interacting with other people. for that. I like rules. I got, uh, good networks.
09:59 Also, I like communicating, interacting with other guys or the. For power lifters. And what's their approach? I'm getting out. Yeah.
10:10 Yeah. I'll say. Um, would you say you've, uh, built a routine of arm? you know, your sense of an activity?
10:22 Yeah, because, uhm, I was not in my home. Don and I couldn't, uh. Joining a gym, I was, uh, a year back, I was not here in, uh, in my home.
10:34 Don and I was somewhere else. . So, I couldn't, uh, get time to go to the gym or any physical activity.
10:41 So, when I came back to my home town, I started a- uh, uh, working out again. So, it's- I have joined it from last, uh, seven months, uh.
10:51 Bye. March or April, so as I remember, yeah. Also. Um. Bye. So well, do you really do your work out too?
11:06 Is it the gym home? all day. Umm, office fees may be a class or a studio. No, is it a gym?
11:12 Completely. Mmm, completely. created. Yeah. Awesome. Um, have you ever worked on the phone before? You mentioned you can- Yeah. Yeah.
11:24 Yeah. During COVID. Yeah. During COVID. I ordered some instant pants because I didn't had any access to- So I ordered some resistant pants of different weights.
11:37 So I had tried working on but- Umm, working at home and working at somewhere at a public place or a gym, gives you a- Good morning.
11:48 It gives a different vibe. Working out at gym, seeing other people, working out, gives us some motivation. Give me some music.
11:56 It's me a motivation. I don't know about others, but it gives me a motivation. That the other guy is working, that other guy is putting some effort.
12:03 Other boy, uhh. Other guy's body is growing. That gives me a motivation too. Yeah. I'm working out at home. All in.
12:12 All in. I felt he, you can carry it on for 2-3 days. But after 2-3 days, there's no motivation. . . Yeah.
12:22 I'll say. Umm, what kind of videos would you use when you- I'd prefer to maybe YouTube videos, or review, refer to your friend, routine, or something like that.
12:35 See ya. Uhh, during 4-bit, well, Instagram was not that much hyped, I used to go for YouTube videos. Well, Instagram, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, I think Instagram is one of the most powerful social media sources, so, on my own words, I can usually- you visit U2 for fitness.
12:55 I just go around the leaves, I check the fields, I follow some, uhh, great, uhh, fitness. That's influencers, so I follow their routine of see how they work out, what kind of, how they, what's their process for their approach.
13:08 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Of training their muscles, yeah. So, what you say, your current workout plan was the right, You know, do you follow the kind of workout that they do?
13:22 Or like, it's a pick and choose kind of something? Thank you. Yeah, sometimes uhh, when I think uhh, see, when uhh, before I joined this.
13:32 Thank much. A six or sevens before, when uhh, the, the time-tune, which uhh, the kind of training, time-tune, which I was following.
13:40 I followed the same, same, uhh, muscle training process, but I found it key, uhh, this is not working out so.
13:47 Bye bye. I told, going with some of the influencers, uhh, advice. So, yeah. Yeah. That's the idea from where it came, like push-pull leg.
13:59 I didn't used to follow it before. Yeah. Yeah. I've, I've, I've, I started following it. Uhh. What's the other way of taking, uhh, the particular body muscle?
14:10 What's the other kind of exercise I can add here? Yeah. That idea I got from the influencer rings of social media.
14:19 I assume. And And we usually adapt your workout according to your fitness grades. Sometimes. sometimes. No, because, umm, I don't usually, uhh, get time.
14:33 I, uhh, I visit gym only for food. It's a week. So it's a little hard for me to adapt now because it's a festive season right now.
14:44 Got it. Yeah. Sure. It'll be hard. Also. Umm, do you hear me? See you better. I'm working out alone on websites.
14:56 I, uh, I prefer. No, I prefer working over the part. No. for you. Thank you. I'm working out alone, uh, alone doesn't work.
15:04 Mm-hmm. If your pattern is there, no, if your pattern is uhh. Uh, around you, he motivates you. Yeah, he pushes you, he pushes, he tells you to push your limits.
15:15 Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, I usually prefer working on the partner, not alone. Mm-hmm. So, would you say, having someone else at, uhm.
15:25 Is better for your own motivation? Yeah, for my own point of view, I think, uh, having someone around is, uh.
15:34 Less point. Mm-hmm. Right, so. Um, is there any- I think that helps you stay consistent, say, you have the appearance, maybe, if you can go on energy, or- is it just part of your routine at this time?
15:53 Oh, it's a part of my routine now. Oh, man. Thank you. Do you have problems like I know? time. Thank you.
