  transcript: {
    q1: {
      question: 'Tell me about your workout routine',
      answer: 'I train 25-30 sets for large muscles, 20 sets for smaller muscles like biceps/triceps. I work out 6 days a week. Frequency is key - every muscle group should be trained twice in a week. All 20 sets must be effective sets, training till failure or very close to failure. On Sunday I do running and sprinting. I also maintain 10,000+ steps daily.'
    },
    q2: {
      question: 'How did you develop this routine?',
      answer: 'Initially I followed traditional split: chest-tri, back-bi, legs. When I did my diploma in nutrition and fitness around 2 years ago, I learned about proper frequency (twice per week per muscle group) and training till failure. That transformed my approach.'
    },
    q3: {
      question: 'How long have you been following this routine?',
      answer: 'Around 8-10 years total, but very seriously for 2.5 years since completing my diploma. I cannot remember the last day I skipped a workout. If I don\'t do my workout, my mood is not good. The muscle pump is my addiction - I can\'t live even a single day without workout.'
    },
    q4: {
      question: 'Did you workout at home during lockdown?',
      answer: 'Yes, during lockdown I worked out at home. I only have one pair of 10kg dumbbells, so I do supersets, compound sets, and take very less rest between sets to train till failure and fatigue my muscles. But I missed gym equipment, mirrors, music, people, and variety of machines.'
    },
    q5: {
      question: 'Do you use apps during workouts?',
      answer: 'I literally don\'t use my phone during workouts. Sometimes before gym I watch old bodybuilders videos on YouTube for motivation - I don\'t use pre-workout supplements, so when I feel low, videos motivate me.'
    },
    q6: {
      question: 'How do you track your progress?',
      answer: 'I track progressive overload - can I do more reps with same weight? When I hit 12+ reps in all sets, I increase the weight. I mainly track progress by pictures and weight. I use Fitter app to upload pictures and compare them over time. I also track it in my phone gallery.'
    },
    q7: {
      question: 'What about recovery and health metrics?',
      answer: 'I use a HART smart ring from Fitter that tracks my resting heart rate, HRV, sleep quality. I check my recovery every morning when I wake up - it\'s very accurate. Once when I was dehydrated, my HRV was low. I drank 2 glasses of water and it went back up. Step count I track through iPhone Health app which syncs with the ring.'
    },
    q8: {
      question: 'Do you have any injuries or health conditions?',
      answer: 'Right now no major injuries. Sometimes slight lower back pain, so I plan my workout accordingly. I skip exercises that cause pain - like replacing squats with leg press when my lower back hurts. I adjust workouts myself based on my diploma knowledge.'
    },
    q9: {
      question: 'Tell me about your diet and nutrition tracking',
      answer: 'I follow structured diet plan 24/7, 365 days. I track macros (mainly protein) and sometimes fiber. I do blood work every 6 months to check for deficiencies. I only use protein shake and creatine supplements - no pre-workout, no BCAA, no multivitamins. I eat 2x my body weight in protein daily to stay full.'
    },
    q10: {
      question: 'Do you use ChatGPT for nutrition?',
      answer: 'Yes! Since ChatGPT came, everything is very easy. I ask it for food replacements - like "what can replace 50g paneer?" and it tells me equivalents (200g curd = 2 whole eggs = 50g paneer). I even upload my photo to estimate body fat percentage - it gives rough idea within 2-5% error, similar to other methods except DEXA.'
    },
    q11: {
      question: 'What are your biggest diet challenges?',
      answer: 'Sweet cravings and hunger are big challenges. I see 700-calorie cheesecake and think "I can\'t afford it." If my hunger is fulfilled, there\'s no bigger challenge. I eat lots of veggies and high protein to stay full all day.'
    },
    q12: {
      question: 'What do you think about the name "BioTrain"?',
      answer: 'BioTrain sounds like biology, science, chemistry - chemical reactions with food and training. Training means all types - not just weight training but running, cycling too. It seems science-packed, like it would tell you which movement impacts which muscle (short-head or long-head pec major or minor). But it seems like only for training, not nutrition.'
    },
    q13: {
      question: 'What personalized nutrition features would help?',
      answer: 'Food preference is the main thing. Give people foods that are convenient for them. Also, AI could generate good recipes from ingredients I have at home. But MUST track raw ingredients - not "one bowl of dal" because I don\'t know how much oil was used. Raw measurements give exact data.'
    },
    q14: {
      question: 'Would recovery tips be helpful?',
      answer: 'Yes - depends on type of soreness. For muscle soreness: heat pack, ice pack, warm clothes, stretching, massage. For nervous system fatigue: take a break, deload workout. Recovery tips would be interesting, especially suggesting when to take breaks.'
    },
    q15: {
      question: 'What about gamification - streaks, badges, leaderboards?',
      answer: 'Not for me personally - I don\'t like notifications. If we have busy schedule and track everything, notifications like "have your meal" or "drink water" are annoying. But some people may like that. For leaderboards - healthy competition works with 4-5 friends who joined together, but not with unknown people. That\'s not comfortable.'
    },
    q16: {
      question: 'Would you prefer seeing your own progress comparison?',
      answer: 'Yes! If app showed my progress from last week vs this week and said "you\'ve outdone yourself from last week" - that is helpful motivation. Visible results are the best motivator. Only the result keeps you motivated - nothing else.'
    },
    q17: {
      question: 'Have you paid for fitness app subscriptions?',
      answer: 'No, but if I had known about Fitter before joining as a coach, I would have paid to train under a Fitter coach. Before diploma I thought natural athletes couldn\'t get good physique or low body fat percentage. After learning from Fitter diploma, I transformed myself and many clients. Fitter has good trust in Indian community.'
    },
    q18: {
      question: 'Do you prefer working out alone or with others?',
      answer: 'I love to work out alone in my own gym. Even if nobody is there, I still love it. But a few people in the gym help motivate us - too much crowd is bad because I can\'t get equipment when needed.'
    },
    q19: {
      question: 'Would live coaching or virtual support be helpful?',
      answer: 'Yes, definitely for beginners. If you\'re beginner and don\'t know how to do workout, video calls or sending videos for form checks would help a lot.'
    },
    q20: {
      question: 'As a Fitter coach, would BioTrain help manage clients?',
      answer: 'Yes, it can be helpful. If the app provides insights on clients, I would be able to manage them better within the app.'
    },
    q21: {
      question: 'How do people around you influence your motivation?',
      answer: 'Positive influence. If I see people with good bodies around me at the gym, it motivates me. It helps me push harder.'
    },
    q22: {
      question: 'What feature would you most want in a fitness app?',
      answer: 'If an app finds a way to keep you motivated, that would be great. But I don\'t even know how to do that. Also, being accurate on raw ingredients is critical for nutrition tracking.'
