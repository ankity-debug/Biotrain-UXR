  transcript: {
    q1: {
      question: 'Tell me about yourself',
      answer: 'Dr. Dhananjay Kumar, Department Head for Airbus working on safety and reliability of aircrafts. Based in UK near London.'
    },
    q2: {
      question: 'What does your typical day look like?',
      answer: 'Wake up, garden walk 10 mins, Surya Namaskar, meditation. Work: check emails, meetings, walk manufacturing line, desk work. After work (5-6pm) gym 2-3x per week. Evening: nap, dinner, reading/TV.'
    },
    q3: {
      question: 'Tell me about your fitness journey',
      answer: 'Most active since 2018. Before that was very busy with job, traveled 2-3 weeks per month across continents, biological clock messed up. Burned out around 2014-2018. After reducing travel, started morning routine (3-4 years now) and regular gym (since COVID ended in 2022). During COVID walked 10-15km daily.'
    },
    q4: {
      question: 'What motivated you to start?',
      answer: 'Burnout from extensive travel and demanding job. Reached a point where I felt "I can\'t do this, I need to change." Also motivated by seeing fit peers doing well.'
    },
    q5: {
      question: 'Tell me about your gym routine',
      answer: 'Saturday: HIIT class 30 mins at 9-10am, then 10 min treadmill cooldown, 10-15 min stretching. 2 more days per week at 12pm or 6pm. Sunday: swimming. Tried yoga, ballet, pilates but enjoys HIIT most.'
    },
    q6: {
      question: 'Preference: home vs gym?',
      answer: 'Gym 100%. Tried home workouts but no motivation. When feeling down at home, can\'t get motivated. At gym, seeing other people doing workouts makes me keep going. Environment and community are key motivators.'
    },
    q7: {
      question: 'Technology and tracking',
      answer: 'Uses Fitbit watch and app. Tracks: heart rate, steps, cardio, specific exercises (swimming, running, cycling, boot camp, etc.). Swimming tracks laps, time, distance. Uses historical data as baseline to motivate - "at least I should do as good as last week" and try to stretch a bit better.'
    },
    q8: {
      question: 'YouTube tutorials and guidance',
      answer: 'Yes tried various tutorials but didn\'t stick to any specific one. Issue: None give complete coverage - everyone has individual perspective (physique, diet, methods). Apps are too generic, not customized for ME specifically. Interested in recording workouts and having online coaches review and give feedback, but has privacy concerns (GDPR regulations in Europe).'
    },
    q9: {
      question: 'Getting back on track after missing workouts',
      answer: 'When I miss workouts, I feel bad. When you get used to doing this, you feel happier after. So that\'s how I get motivation - I\'m missing something, not feeling good, feeling lazy. The feeling of missing out brings me back.'
    },
    q10: {
      question: 'Working out alone vs community',
      answer: 'Community and alone both. Community means gym classes with same people repeatedly - familiar faces help, everyone making jokes, comfortable environment. Age range in classes: 25 to 65-70 years old.'
    },
    q11: {
      question: 'Physical limitations',
      answer: 'Chronic back pain. Have to be very careful with weights. Not bending much, not doing quick movements. Saw physio who gave suggestions on what NOT to do and gave direct plan for back exercises to strengthen it and minimize pain. Learns about safe exercises from different apps and reading.'
    },
    q12: {
      question: 'Would tailored plan for chronic back pain be helpful?',
      answer: 'That would be EXTREMELY helpful. If I could explain my condition (chronic back pain) and get a tailored workout plan, that would be great.'
    },
    q13: {
      question: 'Nutrition and diet',
      answer: 'Have not worked with nutritionist/dietician. Manage diet by myself. Strongly believe my diet is right for me. Don\'t track calories/macros/protein - family members do but not me. No supplements or multivitamins. Not interested in structured diet plans.'
    },
    q14: {
      question: 'What nutrition help would be useful?',
      answer: 'Not a complete diet overhaul. What would be helpful: Know my CURRENT diet, current health parameters, identify the GAP, and make SMALL CHANGES to current diet to improve parameters. Not something completely new. Regionally aware suggestions that adjust MY existing diet would be helpful.'
    },
    q15: {
      question: 'Trust in AI recommendations',
      answer: 'No. AI is buzzword nowadays but needs to be trained more. I ask AI questions and sometimes get very rubbish answers. If you don\'t know the subject yourself, you can be fully misguided. Time has not come yet to be 100% relying on AI. Professionals can use AI and correct it, but not common users with limited knowledge. Would prefer HUMAN can use AI and give me feedback. Psychologically, people moving from state A to state B need human touch - especially older people who are not risk-taking or tech-exposed like Gen Z.'
    },
    q16: {
      question: 'Reminders and notifications',
      answer: 'Yes, notifications definitely help. Gives me something physical/visible that confirms "yeah I have done this" or "missed it." Visual confirmation is helpful.'
    },
    q17: {
      question: 'Fitness goals',
      answer: 'Not trying to build up something. Trying to DECELERATE DEGENERATION of muscle. Want to maintain myself at a certain level. Not trying to be the best in fitness - that\'s not my target. Some goals like "2km run on treadmill smoothly in 10-14 minutes" but not hard and fast about it.'
    },
    q18: {
      question: 'Data privacy and health data sharing',
      answer: 'Living in Europe, approach is GDPR-focused. As long as my data is secure, not misused, not leaked, and if linked then organization is liable - then I\'m comfortable. If they can show data and privacy is protected and not mishandled, and I can trust them, then yes I would share.'
    },
    q19: {
      question: 'Gamification: streaks, leaderboards, badges',
      answer: 'No, not for me. Don\'t like bringing competition into well-being. That\'s charity type of thing - "someone does more so you have to match." Can bring well-being in different way like charity work (this many kilometers = this much donation). Younger generation would be more into competition, but for older people it\'s more about managing health. Age-based approach needed.'
    },
    q20: {
      question: 'Social features: challenges, shared progress',
      answer: 'That can give a bit of motivation yes, but you have to design your app depending on the age group. I will not put it as the main feature - it\'s fine to have but not central. Having people around when working out influences me positively.'
    },
    q21: {
      question: 'Payment willingness',
      answer: 'Have not paid for fitness app before. Would pay if: (1) Sure that data won\'t be misused, (2) Data handling is secure. Want at least 1 month FREE trial/subscription so I can use it and decide. Then can subscribe to annual plan.'
    },
    q22: {
      question: 'Recovery tips and guidance',
      answer: 'Yes, tried to figure out recovery tips but could never figure out from different sources - too many scattered sources. Having all recovery guidance in a unified source would be VERY helpful. Problem is having too many sources of information. Want one-stop-shop that knows my routine, understands it, and acts like personal assistant for fitness.'
    },
    q23: {
      question: 'One-stop personalized fitness assistant',
      answer: 'Yes would be interested! It should have: My personal data (where I am, what I do, what I enjoy, pain points like back pain or injuries). Based on that background, give me suggestions. Should be personalized, not generic. But I will NEVER trust AI directly - I want a person who can use AI and give me evaluated feedback. Human as source of contact is essential.'
    },
    q24: {
      question: 'Name reaction: BioTrain',
      answer: 'Without knowing it\'s fitness app, I would think it\'s about biological trends - could be about insects, human beings, environment, creatures getting extinct. Sounds educational/informational. If I knew it was fitness, I\'d understand it gives trend of my fitness. Name could be improved - something like "Fit Trend" or "Feet Trend" would be catchier and clearer like "Fitbit".'
