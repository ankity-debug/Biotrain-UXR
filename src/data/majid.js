  transcript: {
    q1: {
      question: "Tell me about your current fitness routine and how you track your progress.",
      answer: "I don't really have a structured fitness routine. I try to walk when I can and go swimming occasionally on weekends. I've been thinking about getting more serious about fitness, but I'm not sure where to start. I don't track anything currently."
    },
    q2: {
      question: "What are your main fitness goals, and how do you currently work towards them?",
      answer: "I want to lose some weight and get healthier overall. I've been gaining weight over the past few years due to a sedentary job and poor eating habits. I know I need to make changes, but I feel overwhelmed by all the information out there."
    },
    q3: {
      question: "How do you currently track your nutrition and diet?",
      answer: "I don't track my nutrition at all. I know I should, but it seems so complicated. I try to eat healthier when I can, but I often don't know what's actually good for me. I'd love some simple guidance on what to eat."
    },
    q4: {
      question: "What technology do you currently use for fitness tracking?",
      answer: "I don't use any fitness technology. I'm not very tech-savvy, and most fitness apps seem too complicated. I prefer simple, straightforward approaches. Maybe I'd be open to something basic if it's easy to use."
    },
    q5: {
      question: "What would make you more likely to stick to a fitness program?",
      answer: "I need something that's really simple and doesn't require a lot of knowledge upfront. Some kind of guidance or coaching would be helpful. Also, I'd prefer something that doesn't require going to a gym since I find gyms intimidating."
    },
    q6: {
      question: "How much are you willing to spend on fitness apps or services?",
      answer: "I'd prefer something free or very cheap, maybe $5-10 per month. I'm just starting out, so I don't want to invest a lot of money until I know it's going to work for me."
    },
    q7: {
      question: "What frustrates you most about current fitness apps?",
      answer: "They're too complicated and assume you already know a lot about fitness. I need something that starts from the basics and guides me through everything. Also, most apps seem designed for people who are already fit."
