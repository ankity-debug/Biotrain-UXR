  transcript: {
    q1: {
      question: 'Tell me about yourself',
      answer: 'I am Jessica, 36 years old, I teach English at school (Grade 1). I am quite active - I walk a lot with students, keep up 10,000 steps per day. I wake up at 5am for work.'
    },
    q2: {
      question: 'What does your typical day look like?',
      answer: 'Wake up 5am, work at school (very active with grade 1 students), after work go to gym for group classes. I joined gym in March during Ramadan offer, extended for 6 months. On Sundays I have social walking group I am part of since last year.'
    },
    q3: {
      question: 'What motivated you to start?',
      answer: 'Some weight gain and wanting better work-life balance. Teaching is stressful, I needed fitness for stress relief.'
    },
    q4: {
      question: 'Do you prefer working out alone or with others?',
      answer: 'I prefer group classes with other people. I was doing one-on-one PT sessions but stopped due to cost, time, and knee injury. Now I do group classes - more affordable and social. Feedback from other people helps me more than visual progress - they notice changes before I do.'
    },
    q5: {
      question: 'Tell me about your diet challenges',
      answer: 'I had nutritionist design meal plan but struggle to execute. When I come home from stressful work, I do not feel like cooking. I live alone so cooking creates food waste - making different meals, stuff left over, sometimes I buy food and it just rots. I am pescatarian so meal prep services have limited options.'
    },
    q6: {
      question: 'Do you track your fitness?',
      answer: 'I use Apple Watch to track steps mostly. I have smart scale that shows weight but it is not motivating when I see weight going up even though PT said I am building muscle. I track menstrual cycle with Flo app - my energy varies by cycle phase. I would be interested in cycle-aware workout and diet suggestions.'
    },
    q7: {
      question: 'What would help you be more consistent?',
      answer: 'Stressful weeks at school throw me off. If I have stuff to do at school, that kind of puts me off in terms of getting things done. Holidays and weekends help. To be honest, even though gym app sends daily reminders about protein and steps, I do not engage with that.'
    }
