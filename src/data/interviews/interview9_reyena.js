### Looking For
"If I could get personalized workouts which I can do at home, that would be great."
- Home workout app (30 min - 1 hour daily)
- Workout + Nutrition combined
- Pre-workout and post-workout meal guidance
- 3 days/week workout preference
- Prefers 30-minute follow-along videos over short clips
- Wants basic exercises (yoga, hand exercises)

### App Preferences
- Notifications: 1 pre-workout + 1 post-workout = GOOD; continuous = ANNOYING
- Prefers longer workout videos (30 min) to follow along
- Would work out alone at home, not with others
- Interested in calorie tracking to make better food choices
- "If there are two things and less calories, I would opt for the second option"

### Social Features & Motivation
- Leaderboards: Prefers SELF-comparison over comparing with others
- "I'll get to know what I have improved or maybe demotivated"
- Family motivation is positive (husband in fitness helps)
- Both visible progress AND external compliments motivate
- Wants to see weekly progress: "This week vs last week"

- Wants live coach or chat support for doubts

- Prefers human touch over pure AI
- "AI is okay but human touch would be great. So that I could know 100% genuine."

### Data Privacy
- Would share medical data IF privacy assured
- Comfortable with notifications permission only
- Concerns about finance apps accessing gallery/contacts
- "Until and unless it is only in the app, that is fine"
- Fitness apps need minimal permissions

### Name Feedback: "BioTrain"
"It looks nice... BioTrain. By the word, we come to know that it might be something related to training of fitness."
- Name sounds fitness-related
- No strong emotional reaction (not super motivating/exciting)
- Relevant for fitness app
- No specific improvements suggested

### Equipment & Space
- Main challenge: Equipment availability
- Wants to be informed beforehand what's needed
- Timing consistency can be challenging
- Has terrace space for activities

### Key Challenges
1. **Food Cravings**: "I crave junk. So I end up cheating."
2. **Equipment**: "Basic thing when we start workout will be the equipment"
3. **Timing**: "Every day there might be something or the other coming up"
4. **Motivation**: Needs consistent reminders and structure

### Ideal Features
1. **Workout + Nutrition integration**
2. **30-minute follow-along videos**
3. **Calorie tracking with healthier alternatives**
4. **Recipe suggestions**
5. **Live chat support for doubts**

- Progress: Weekly self-comparison

### Key Quotes

"If I can get my own leaderboard, I'll come to know what's going on and what's not going on."

"It will feel like we are doing it along with the video. That will be more motivating."

"For me it would be like three days a week where I can work out."

"That might, you know, get motivation for you also by seeing others' progress."

### Workout Preferences
- **Type**: Yoga, basic exercises
- **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Frequency**: 3 days/week
- **Format**: Long follow-along videos
- **Environment**: Alone at home
- **Support**: Live chat available for questions
