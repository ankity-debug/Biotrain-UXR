  transcript: {
    q1: {
      question: 'Tell me about yourself',
      answer: 'I\'m Dhruv, used to be in Mumbai, now in Dubai for 6 months. I\'m a fitness professional, trainer working with MyPT brand.'
    },
    q2: {
      question: 'What does your typical day look like?',
      answer: 'Wake up 5am for 6am clients. Work 6-10am (peak hours). Depending on shift, either leave at 3pm or stay till 3pm then return 5-8pm for evening peak. Squeeze in my own workouts during gaps between clients. Track steps and calories when I have mental capacity.'
    },
    q3: {
      question: 'Tell me about your fitness journey',
      answer: 'Athletic background, been into fitness 5-7 years. I\'m 24-25 now. Started because I was curious about learning and studying fitness, so enrolled in internationally renowned courses. That\'s how it all began.'
    },
    q4: {
      question: 'What are your current goals?',
      answer: 'Performance goal: achieve certain bench press KG for certain reps. Looks goal: want to look a certain way. Health: last priority (cholesterol, BP) but still monitored. Currently 25% body fat, want to get to 20% while retaining muscle and increasing weights moderately (2.5-5kg increases).'
    },
    q5: {
      question: 'Tell me about your workout routine',
      answer: 'Resistance training/hypertrophy for muscle mass. Machine-based, dumbbells, cables. 3-4 sets per exercise, 18-25 working sets total per workout, pushing most sets close to failure. Split: Day 1 Push (chest/shoulder/tricep), Day 2 Pull (back/biceps), Day 3 Lower body. Get 8 workouts per month on low side, 12-15 on high side depending on health and mental capacity.'
    },
    q6: {
      question: 'Home workouts vs gym?',
      answer: 'Gym 100%. During COVID I ordered weights at home (no bodyweight stuff). But open chain movements (dumbbells) work better for me than closed chain (bodyweight/calisthenics). I don\'t enjoy the pump and muscle-mind connection with bodyweight. Used to just get a pump at home to feel good but no real routine.'
    },
    q7: {
      question: 'How comfortable with fitness apps?',
      answer: 'Very comfortable. I understand the importance because when I started tracking workouts, I had 15-20% exponential increase in results. Tracking was a game changer. Helps ensure progressive overload - not just guessing or stepping down. Knowing my numbers is key to results.'
    },
    q8: {
      question: 'Do you work out alone or with others?',
      answer: 'I WANT workouts to be alone. It\'s my ME time. I don\'t like any distractions or talking to people. I\'m okay with people thinking I\'m arrogant for not talking. I really dislike when somebody is there talking. I just put in earphones and get my work done. That\'s my style.'
    },
    q9: {
      question: 'What do you track?',
      answer: 'Recently got Whoop - tracking sleep, HRV (heart rate variability), steps. Trying to understand the science and apply it to my life. Use Hevy app for workout tracking (sets, reps, weights, RPE, drop sets, failure sets, warmup sets). HealthifyMe for calorie and macro tracking. Some Excel sheets for client workout calculations (1RM maxes, target heart rates). Also Apple Health for overview.'
    },
    q10: {
      question: 'Why did Whoop interest you?',
      answer: 'HRV (heart rate variability) is the key. People used to think every heartbeat is same distance apart, but it\'s not. Lesser distance = parasympathetic tone (recovery, calmness). Increased distance = sympathetic tone (fight or flight). That data is really important for understanding recovery. Whoop is subscription model - pay yearly, get device free.'
    },
    q11: {
      question: 'How does tracking help day-to-day?',
      answer: 'If HRV is trending good and one day it drops, I ask "what did I do different?" If I find the cause, I start avoiding or doing less of that. Looking for patterns and cause-effect relationships.'
    },
    q12: {
      question: 'How do you handle missed workouts?',
      answer: 'Right now I\'m not tracking calories or steps - just existing and having overview of trends. When I\'m "in the game" tracking calories, I beat myself up if not following. But I make it sustainable - if supposed to eat 1800 harsh deficit, I make it 2200-2300 so I can sustain it. I promote sustainability so I don\'t beat myself up. I don\'t track perfectly all the time.'
    },
    q13: {
      question: 'Visible progress vs feedback from others?',
      answer: 'For me it\'s visible progress, but mixture of both helps.'
    },
    q14: {
      question: 'Reminders and notifications?',
      answer: 'Would be frustrating. When I don\'t track calories and HealthifyMe shows popup "you\'re back", I get maybe 1% negative feeling - reminds me I\'m a failure. Maybe neutral about it overall.'
    },
    q15: {
      question: 'Biggest challenge maintaining routine?',
      answer: 'DIET part. Never the workout or steps - always the diet. Following calories, hitting protein goal, eating clean. That\'s the hardest.'
    },
    q16: {
      question: 'How do you track progress toward goals?',
      answer: 'Hevy app shows when I hit new PR with stars and rewards - "first time you hit this weight" or volume achievements. I prepare for PR with 2 weeks intense training, 1 week deload for muscle recovery, then go for PR and log it.'
    },
    q17: {
      question: 'Physical limitations or health concerns?',
      answer: 'Bad sleep, frequently falling ill, higher level cholesterol (don\'t feel it but it\'s a concern).'
    },
    q18: {
      question: 'Interest in app taking all data and giving tailored advice?',
      answer: 'YES! I would consider whatever advice they give. I always used to find a HUGE GAP between having to switch between apps - calorie tracking, workout tracking, 10 other places. I always wished I had only ONE application for all of this.'
    },
    q19: {
      question: 'Comfort sharing health data?',
      answer: 'For me it\'s not an issue. I don\'t have concerns. I\'ll be open about it.'
    },
    q20: {
      question: 'Ever worked with nutritionist?',
      answer: 'No. I just track calories - give myself budget of 2300 calories, keep it mostly clean, try to hit protein goals. It\'s flexible dieting, not chicken-broccoli-rice every day. If I constrain myself to same stuff, I can\'t do it more than 10 days.'
    },
    q21: {
      question: 'Would variety in diet help consistency?',
      answer: '100% yes. I find myself referring to ChatGPT for lower-calorie tasty versions, but AI doesn\'t give me enough variety options or regional palette. If algorithm could consider all parameters - low fiber trend, certain mineral/vitamin causing issues - I would REALLY love that data.'
    },
    q22: {
      question: 'Trust in AI recommendations?',
      answer: 'Maybe it\'s my prompting style, but as fitness professional I know certain answers. When I ask AI, it gets MAJORITY right but that NICHE specific answer I\'m looking for, it doesn\'t get right. Gives generally correct answer but not the specific one I need.'
    },
    q23: {
      question: 'Does diet affect workout or vice versa?',
      answer: 'Diet affects my workout. When on deficit for long time, I feel depleted - the way I look, my motivation, performance. I see numbers going down. But I\'ve convinced myself this is what the process looks like, so it doesn\'t bother me enough.'
    },
    q24: {
      question: 'Supplements?',
      answer: 'Currently no. But top tier supplements for me would be: whey protein, creatine, omega-3. Right now just on cruise mode due to work commitment not giving enough time to focus on all of it (workouts + diet + supplements). If it happens then well and good.'
    },
    q25: {
      question: 'Culturally relevant diet suggestions helpful?',
      answer: 'Yes helpful. HealthifyMe does that - has all Indian foods, never fails to identify food from photo or estimate amounts. But YOUR suggestion of getting recommendations would be great addition.'
    },
    q26: {
      question: 'Other fitness apps you use?',
      answer: 'HealthifyMe for calorie/macro tracking (not MyFitnessPal because no free AI photo feature, and I\'m used to HealthifyMe UI from my 120kg→83kg transformation). Hevy for workout tracking. Whoop for biometrics. Apple Health for heart rate and steps overview. Excel for client calculations.'
    },
    q27: {
      question: 'What makes HealthifyMe good?',
      answer: 'Calorie tracking and flexibility. If I want pizza or vadapav, I know I\'ll sacrifice later in day. I just log the meal - if 1 vadapav, I put 1.5 for margin of error. Then stress-free about hitting fitness goals. Even after a year I can go back to specific date and see exactly what I did and compare.'
    },
    q28: {
      question: 'What makes Hevy good for workouts?',
      answer: 'Shows record of sets, exercises, weights. Can add RPE rating (how difficult set was), mark drop set, failure set, warmup set. Lots of flexibility. Advanced data like MRV (maximum recoverable volume) - if I want to grow biceps/triceps, give it good volume like 20 working sets per week. Haven\'t seen any other app utilize data like this.'
    },
    q29: {
      question: 'Does Hevy integrate with Whoop?',
      answer: 'It does but I haven\'t used that feature. Just use it for workout tracking.'
    },
    q30: {
      question: 'Manual vs automatic tracking preference?',
      answer: 'Don\'t know how to track automatically where weights and sets are recorded. Hevy has wearable option to track from Apple Watch - put in manually and click on set. That\'s as automatic as it gets for weight training.'
    },
    q31: {
      question: 'Ever stopped using app due to privacy concerns?',
      answer: 'No, but stopped using many apps because user interface is very difficult to crack and other applications are good enough that I don\'t have to make the switch.'
    },
    q32: {
      question: 'What does "BioTrain" name make you feel?',
      answer: 'As a professional, makes me feel like it must be some advanced application tracking biometrics and things important for training or health. Makes me imagine Dr. Huberman or Dr. Layne Norton (influencer-scientists). Resonates with how Layne Norton has app called "Carbon". For me it seems okish. Maybe could be improved but I\'m not that creative. Don\'t know how impactful it will be for layman though.'
    },
    q33: {
      question: 'Streaks, leaderboards, badges - helpful or frustrating?',
      answer: 'Haven\'t done it myself but seen clients crazy about it. But I know they can\'t be at best game throughout. When they\'re not doing well, they just won\'t bother about it or it showcases they\'re a failure. But when they\'re at peak, it\'s the BEST element to keep them engaged. For me, streak isn\'t most important. If it was keeping me engaged but I fail, I\'d be like "it\'s fine, not that important." What would REALLY hurt me: seeing weight I used to lift going down, or calorie tracking going down. Those parameters hurt me, not streaks.'
    },
    q34: {
      question: 'Do streaks demotivate clients on rest days?',
      answer: 'Kind of maybe. Not sure how hard they take it.'
    },
    q35: {
      question: 'Features in fitness apps you dislike?',
      answer: 'As fitness professional: Like MyZone in our gym has algorithm to calculate "map" that only shoots up when training very hard (95% heart rate max). Not recommendable for anyone above 40 with health issues. But people train like that because it helps them get on leaderboard and burn more calories. Only professionals understand it\'s guiding them in WRONG manner. As coach it makes me feel this is wrong thing to channelize.'
    },
    q36: {
      question: 'Recovery tips delivery preference?',
      answer: 'Not sure. Don\'t think I\'ve come across anything impressive for recovery. People think recovery is massage or foam rolling, but recovery is really: hydration, getting steps in, sleeping better. Those basics come first. Entire fitness industry: if you want to SELL something make it fancy, if you want something to WORK make it SIMPLE. Nothing more important than sleep, movement, calorie tracking, protein, fiber, working out. Usually misguided with fancy things that don\'t have more than 5% impact. Would really want something promoting RIGHT STUFF where people see changes by doing SIMPLER things.'
    },
    q37: {
      question: 'Busting common fitness myths - would people be interested?',
      answer: 'Not sure whether people would be interested, but that will create IMPACT.'
    },
    q38: {
      question: 'Ever paid for fitness app?',
      answer: 'No, but always considered paying for HealthifyMe Pro because it unlocks micronutrients - would understand how much micronutrients I get and trends. Didn\'t pay due to diet going up and down and moving to Dubai. But anytime soon if I get serious I\'ll obviously pay - it\'s worth the investment.'
    },
    q39: {
      question: 'What features would you pay for?',
      answer: 'If I get to know trend that my diet is lacking certain micronutrient and that\'s causing me to fall ill frequently - that\'s a GAME CHANGER. If I have bout of bad sleep throughout week and I see direct correlation to certain micronutrient being less or other factor - it\'s straight away connecting dots. Worth investment and it\'s only like ₹3000 for entire year in Indian rupees.'
    },
    q40: {
      question: 'Reasonable price for integrated one-stop app?',
      answer: 'If it combines Hevy and HealthifyMe the way I like it, I wouldn\'t mind paying ₹5000 Indian rupees for entire year. That\'s in context to what HealthifyMe already offers.'
    },
    q41: {
      question: 'Prefer annual vs monthly plan?',
      answer: 'Yes annual, because I know I\'m consistent with it and it\'s useful for me. Worth the investment to go for entire year.'
    },
    q42: {
      question: 'Ever need guidance or sounding board?',
      answer: '100% yes. I have my own mentors and people from internet - people with experience, not even necessarily educated. Sometimes they mention something, I try it, and I\'m surprised I wasn\'t aware of it. I do have moments where I feel there\'s much more to learn. Try to keep myself humble so I can understand and learn more from them.'
    },
    q43: {
      question: 'Do you reach out for help or do they intervene?',
      answer: 'Usually I reach out - put open-ended questions, try to set up situations where they can help and guide. Through that I come up with solution I never thought I wanted. Then I figure it out and I\'m surprised - "all this while I was doing it wrong."'
    },
    q44: {
      question: 'Live coach or virtual support helpful?',
      answer: 'Yes in context to entire lifestyle and holistic changes. But for PT (personal training) I have my own bias - I think personal training should be IN PERSON.'
    },
    q45: {
      question: 'Do people around you influence positively or negatively?',
      answer: 'Mixture of both. Days where I feel intimidated by people existing. Days where I\'m feeling happy and good and I want people to exist around.'
    },
    q46: {
      question: 'Would integrated app help from trainer perspective?',
      answer: 'YES! All this while I had issues with certain apps not doing well. I would really want best part of each app mixed together. I would really want application where I can have my own CLIENT DASHBOARD and maneuver it from there. Different apps have different flaws. Overcoming those flaws and combining best of all platforms - if there are even more features, I would REALLY love that.'
    },
    q47: {
      question: 'App more helpful for you as trainer or as gym-goer?',
      answer: 'BOTH! I would really want as a trainer a section where client data is there, calorie tracking is happening, AND my own stuff can also be done. Want unified portal to see clients\' data, tracking they\'re doing - that would be helpful from trainer point of view 100%.'
    },
    q48: {
      question: 'Would you use AI recommendations for clients?',
      answer: 'I would want AI to exist in every aspect, but then I would cherry-pick accordingly. I would want suggestions from AI but then select what works.'
    },
    q49: {
      question: 'Any other features not covered?',
      answer: 'Nothing readily available. Usually these things I go through and have ideas in that moment. Next time I face something I\'ll probably write it down and send it.'
