      question: 'Tell me about yourself',
      answer: 'I am Aniket from Tanvad, India. I work in family business of machinery and iron parts factory.'

    q2: {
      question: 'What does your typical day look like?',
      answer: 'Wake 7:30am, gym 1.5hrs, breakfast, office/factory work, lunch, 45min nap, back to office, evening walk 25-30min, then home with friends.'
    },
    q3: {
      question: 'What motivated you to start working out?',
      answer: 'COVID lockdown made me restless, felt body not productive. When gym opened 6-7 months ago, I joined and felt joy, enjoyed working out, enjoyed interacting with people, got good networks.'
    },
    q4: {
      question: 'Do you prefer working out alone or with others?',
      answer: 'With partner is better - he motivates me, pushes my limits. Working alone does not work. Seeing other people at gym also motivates me - seeing their body grow gives me motivation.'
    },
    q5: {
      question: 'Tell me about your diet',
      answer: 'Trainer designed my diet focused on calorie surplus for weight gain. I cook my own food and enjoy it. Very honest with diet when at home. Trainer asked comprehensive questions about my goals, health, family history.'
    },
    q6: {
      question: 'Have you tried fitness apps?',
      answer: 'Tried Fitter app 4 years ago but timing did not match - gym closed during COVID. Tried ChatGPT for diet, found it well-prepared but did not follow through. I keep notifications OFF, they become annoying.'
    },
    q7: {
      question: 'How much would you pay for a fitness app?',
      answer: 'Depends on services. I would pay 2,500-4,000 rupees/year ($30-48/year). I prefer annual subscription because price is less. I want flexibility - 1 month, 3 months, 6 months options.'
