  transcript: {
    q1: {
      question: 'Tell me about yourself',
      answer: 'My name is Majid, I work in UAE as sales promoter in retail. I do 9-10 hours job. I used to play cricket before moving to UAE. During COVID I gained weight eating junk food, realized I needed to change when I could not fit formal shirt for interview.'
    },
    q2: {
      question: 'Tell me about your fitness routine',
      answer: 'I hit gym 3-4 days per week doing compound exercises - squats, deadlifts, chest press, pull-ups. I focus on athletic training not bodybuilding. I also do hiking, running, sprinting. I am pursuing personal trainer and nutrition certifications as hobby.'
    },
    q3: {
      question: 'What is your biggest challenge?',
      answer: 'For me, more problem comes to nutrition part. It is quite difficult to track. We really need something much more accountable, awareness, and disciplinary action for nutrition. I believe this is main problem for EVERYONE.'
    },
    q4: {
      question: 'Do you track your fitness?',
      answer: 'I use Garmin watch (more accurate than others) to track steps, heart rate, calories as guideline - not 100% dependable. I question accuracy like how do they calculate 600 calories for sandwich? Which metrics? I focus on workout volume and intensity to track progress.'
    },
    q5: {
      question: 'Tell me about your diet',
      answer: 'I do not cook much, I eat out - grilled chicken, soups, rotis. I watch portions, avoid junk food, no artificial sugar. I need carbs because of 9-hour standing job. I recently started supplements - whey protein, creatine (best thing, gives me more power), multivitamins.'
    },
    q6: {
      question: 'Have you used fitness apps?',
      answer: 'I used I Muscle 2 and Workout Planner apps to learn anatomy and exercises. Accuracy concerns stopped me from using more apps. Applications should customize to individual requirements not generic plans. If AI can tailor plan to my routine and goals, everyone should try it.'
    },
    q7: {
      question: 'How much would you pay?',
      answer: 'People pay AED 100-150/hour for training here ($27-41/hour). For app, depends on services. Should have flexible options - 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year. Do not pressure client, let them try 1 month and see results before committing to longer.'
