  transcript: {
    q1: {
      question: "Tell me about your current fitness routine and how you track your progress.",
      answer: "I go to the gym 5-6 times a week, mostly focusing on strength training. I use a basic fitness app to track my workouts, but I find it quite limiting. I wish there was something more comprehensive that could give me personalized recommendations based on my goals and progress."
    },
    q2: {
      question: "What are your main fitness goals, and how do you currently work towards them?",
      answer: "My primary goals are building muscle mass and improving my overall strength. I also want to reduce body fat. Currently, I follow a program I found online, but I'm not sure if it's the most effective for my specific body type and goals."
    },
    q3: {
      question: "How do you currently track your nutrition and diet?",
      answer: "I use MyFitnessPal to track calories and macros, but it's quite tedious. I often forget to log meals, and the database isn't always accurate. I'd love something that could automatically suggest meals based on my goals and preferences."
    },
    q4: {
      question: "What technology do you currently use for fitness tracking?",
      answer: "I have a fitness tracker that monitors my steps and heart rate, plus the MyFitnessPal app. I also use YouTube for workout videos. I'm open to trying new tech if it can provide real value and isn't too complicated to use."
    },
    q5: {
      question: "What would make you more likely to stick to a fitness program?",
      answer: "I need something that's personalized to my goals and adapts as I progress. Real-time feedback and motivation would be great. Also, having a community aspect where I can connect with others with similar goals would be motivating."
    },
    q6: {
      question: "How much are you willing to spend on fitness apps or services?",
      answer: "I'm willing to pay for quality. If an app can provide personalized coaching, meal planning, and progress tracking all in one, I'd pay up to $50-100 per month. The key is that it needs to deliver real results."
    },
    q7: {
      question: "What frustrates you most about current fitness apps?",
      answer: "Most apps are too generic and don't adapt to my specific needs. They also don't integrate well with each other. I have to use multiple apps for different aspects of fitness, which becomes overwhelming and time-consuming."
